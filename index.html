On his next turn after that he must pass a Hard (-20%) T test to recover, rerolling each turn until he succeeds. The blow has fractured his skull, causing a splinter of bone to press into his brain and starting a slow bleeding between the brain and the skull that will keep expanding, eventually killing him unless pressure is relieved. He’ll suffer a cumulative penalty of –5% to his WS, BS, Ag, Int and Fel every two hours, falling into a coma when any of those characteristics reaches zero, dying within another d10/2 days. The only effective cure is a procedure called trepanation, which involves removing a piece of the skull by drilling or boring into it, thus relieving the pressure and allowing access to remove the splinter. This requires at least one hour and a Challenging (-10%) Heal test with the Surgery Talent. If successful, a metal plate of some kind, usually a silver coin that has been hammered flat and polished, is used to cover the hole, nailed directly to the surrounding bone and then covered with a flap of the scalp. If already in a coma, your opponent will then wake up in another d10/2 days, otherwise regaining his lost characteristics at a rate of 5% per day. Failure will still relieve the pressure but causes brain damage, reducing WS, BS, Ag, Int and Fel by –10% permanently. Regardless of outcome, your opponent will have to pass a Challenging (-10%) T test immediately after the surgery or contract a serious infection, killing him within d10 days unless a successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell is performed."
