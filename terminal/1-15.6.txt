Data Log#005:

I realize now that it was not me who lost faith, but them. Captain Titus and the Lord Militant have given in to the ruinous powers. We have been eating our own dead for over a year. Of course it was, all the signs were there I was just too blind to see them. It was not the God Emperor who gave us our strength back but something far more foul. If I hadn't listened to them we maybe could have had more time to have done something about it. But I have gotten some of us together who still have faith in the Emperor and we are going to put a stop to this. 

Over a year we have been giving in to this blasphemous ritual. It must end now if we are to have any hope in redemption. Help is not coming, I'm not convinced the Lord Militant ever even tried. He wants it this way, keeps him in control. I saw the freezers, hundreds of dead being prepared for our meals. Corpse starch is carefully recycled in a way to not be harmful, this goes beyond utility and into madness. I and the others are prepared to die standing with the God Emperor and the preservation of the sanctity of his holy form. 

May he bless my endeavors and forgive my transgressions.
