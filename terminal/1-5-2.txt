*Vox Conversation Log*

Vivinci: Hey! I'm only working Shift A for the next two chrono segments if you want to go grab some drinks sometime during that period. I know we left things at a bad place last time and I'd like a chance to make it up to you.

Bilda: Honestly that feels so long ago that it doesn't bother me, I wasn't even thinking about it at this point. I'd love to grab some drinks! But...

Vivinci: But what? You said yourself you'd enjoy it, would be good for you to get out of that place for a bit.

Bilda: I was caught giving a patient some painimmune during a surgery yesterday, it wasn't covered under Peregrinus's insurance and so I had to choose to either pay it myself or work some extra shifts. So safe to say I'm working double time for the next three chrono segements. Like I said, I'd love to go but, I won't have any spare time.

Vivinci: I understand, well if you free up somehow, let me know. I'm here.
