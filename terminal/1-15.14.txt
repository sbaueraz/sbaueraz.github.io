Log#003:

The Lord Militant almost woke up, but the Emperor is right, we can't have that, not while my vision is not yet finished. I have begun feeding him the holy flesh of the fallen. It fills him and I with blessed energy and our flesh swells. It will also deliver strength back to the faithful.

I have already had those closest to me flay the fallen heretics. They will be the first feast. We have received word from the tech adepts that help is on the way. A scouting party sent to discover the fate of the Lord Militant. But it is too soon. I have arranged for them to be welcomed in, so that they too can add to the feast. Any future attempts to meddle with the God Emperors plans for me will be met with similar resolve. They will not understand, they don't hear him the way I do...
