Hey Gad,

Just got done with my shift at the at the manufactorum, I'm still working on that bad hip but the herbs you gave are dulling the pain pretty good. I went for a walk the other day down to the old culvert by Hab Structure Y-000736 and said my prayers to Drusus. Hard to believe that little shrine is still there all these years. Pretty sure us old timers are the only folk who know about it down there. I saw Schumer down there, he's looking worse than me. Pretty sure he inhaled a few too many chems during the year that the Skaelen-Har were coming down hard over the Hammerers strike. Anyways, we left our offerings there, pretty good one if I say so myself, good luck topping me this week you old coot. Anyways, see you at breakfast next week.
