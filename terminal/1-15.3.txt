Data Log#002:

Two months now have passed. I will be out of nutrient tablets within the next week that we've been using to try and augment our meals. Good men and women are starting to get worried that we are going to starve, I've been trying to console them like Captain Titus said but even I'm starting to wonder. I've had half a dozen people in the last few days come in collapsing from malnutrition and the only thing I can do is send them to the Chaplain for prayer.
