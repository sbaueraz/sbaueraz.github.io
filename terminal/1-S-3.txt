⌧  The building is nearing completion, looks like I'll be here a lot in the coming days and years. Can't believe I was lucky enough to land a position as a manufactorum overseer. There's been some turbulant times in my life where I thought things were going pretty rocky. But the Emperor must have blessed me or something because nothing short of a catastrophic hivequake could stop me now! Incase I'm too excited to remember down the road, if things ever get bad I hid a little something special under the floor across from my desk. Here's to a bright future for the Imperium!
