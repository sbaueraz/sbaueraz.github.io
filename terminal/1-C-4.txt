        Hey Helzie! 
I’m new here and was told you’d be the best person to ask for some tips. Is it true that the Palebrands have worked here for 6 generations? Ralph Peregrinus and Son must be a great place to work! They told me I’d be reporting to the corpse vats. Hopefully it’s more pleasant than that sounds. 
I’ve been staying on the streets over in the Lower Yatuno so I’m hoping I can be assigned some housing nearby? I was told that there would be an included hab residence in my contract but I’m not really sure I read it all correctly; my Shift Manager went over things really quickly.
Anyways, I just wanted to reach out and make a friend here, so if you get this please leave a response and see if you can find me over in the corpse vats! I’ll be in one of the new recruit uniforms in grey so just ask for Lelt and if you mention the email I guess I’ll know it’s you!
