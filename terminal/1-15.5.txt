Data Log#004:

The God Emperor does indeed smile upon us! I had given up on these logs after I gave us up for dead, but today the Captain Titus revealed that he had witheld a surplus of rations to weed out heretics in our midst. I must say I am glad I passed the test and may the God Emperor forgive any thoughts I had of him abandoning us. 

For the past month we have been eating well and I can see strength returning to several of our troops. We may just last until our help arrives. The next hurdle is going to be figuring out this disease that plagues us. I have noticed several people coming in with bad trembles and abdominable pain. My medispex is telling me there is signs of nerve damage as well. Could radiation be leaking in somewhere? I brought this information to Captain Titus and he said that the Lord Militant wants me to keep these findings to myself for now. After my lack of faith previously I know now that my commanders can be trusted.
