I don't have much time as my rebreather is running low. After a mutant attack I lost track of the rest of my company who retreated off without me. The last thing I expected to find is who I will call Gasmask Man since he seems to be mute and makes no effort to identify himself as anything else. I'm not sure if he's friend or foe but he doesn't seem to have taken any hostile action towards me.

My wounds are bad and I'm trying to convince him to help me, my weapon is nearly spent and I have no medical supplies, he seems to want to barter for goods, I don't have anything to give him but hopefully the Emperors light shines on me and he takes mercy on my soul. Otherwise I won't last long here. 

Can't believe those bastards ran off without me, if whoever reads this ever meets Ordicus Prawn punch that bastard across the face for me and damn his soul.
