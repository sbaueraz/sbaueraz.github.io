        Though numerous complications have arrived I have not lost faith in the idol, or in the goal that will bring renewed glory to the Calixis Sector. This opportunity has come to us, but it is to the people of the Imperium that will benefit from the arrival of the Emperor Restored. I think back now to Gaad and Nani when they approached me of their plan. The doubt that filled my heart would fill that of others if we revealed ourselves to them too soon. They would not understand our goals. In time we will be recognized as saints, equal among Drusus and others for our involvement in bringing about His glorious arrival. 
        Our part of this journey is over, but theirs is beginning. With their training and placement within the Imperiums highest echelon they will be uniquely blessed in spreading the will of the Emperor. Then, when he is ready to return to the Calixis, we will be ready for him. 
        As expected, the Panaards faith in our work has not wavered. Even from my lofty position I envy their devotion. Xavier and Geroza, who one would expect to hold the greatest faith in our work hold on too tightly to St Drusus to truly embrace our cause, however they and everyone else has held fast to our plan. Going forward we will meet less frequently, only to ensure that we are still on course. I await the day we see the fruits of our labors, until then.  
        I tread the path of Righteousness. Though it be paved with broken glass, I will walk it barefoot; though it cross rivers of fire, I will pass over them; though it wanders wide, the light of the Emperor guides my step.
