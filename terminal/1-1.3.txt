Gady bear,

I miss you so much my big strong Gady. I'm absolutely loving my time in the Upper Hive. The nobles have so many great delights up here that you wouldn't believe, I can't wait to come down and visit, I'm so sorry I had to cancel the last three times but I'm sure you understand, security is just so tight up here and then that last time with my sister visiting. Ugh, I just want to be there with you so badly, I don't care that it's a slump, or that you're poor. Age is just a number, and I'm still so tired of these noble "men" who don't know how to treat a woman. But I wish everything was all sunshine and roses, my husband has cut me off from his funds, I think he might suspect I've been talking to a real man. I want to schedule a trip down, but the guards are going to need a bribe... Gady, if you could transfer me 1,000 Scabs I bet that would grease their palms, and then I could get down there to grease something of yours. I set up an account with the Administratum at the Adeptus Terra Treasury under the account# T-Zeta 34690000000003. You can deposit the funds  there so I can get this ball rolling. And then maybe I can get to rolling your- *DATA CORRUPT/Error O-Fans*
