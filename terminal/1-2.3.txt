	All these years, I've found my old entry and reread it, how different time has made these observations. Time has also changed my friends. What once seemed like such a lofty goal now seems warped, twisted by some unseen hand. Could this be the work of something other than the God Emperor? Some darker forces hand at work over my friends? 
	We kept contact to a minimum, but Miss Vynes and the Panaards I know have been in close contact with the object over the years, and it has changed them. They speak of a change in the plan, one that doesn't involve our children? I'm torn, on one hand it keeps them more distant from harms way, yet this was all for them, are we now to gain all the glory for ourselves? 
	Lethe and I will speak with them soon, how my heart longs to see our child again, see how they have grown, explain everything to them so they can finally know how great their purpose is. Emperor guide us along the correct path.
