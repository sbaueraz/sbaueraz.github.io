Data Log#001:

It has been one week since what we now believe to have been a Hivequake trapped us. Power has come back online and so I can start leaving proper documentation. A scouting party was sent out at the Lord Militants order and only one person came back with heavy burns from the acidic air and with intense radiation poisoning. Despite my teams best treatments he did not survive more than a few hours. 

Without proper equipment we are trapped here until reinforcements arrive. Captain Titus has informed us that they have gotten vox communication from the Magistratum and that help will be organized soon. While my faith in our commander and the God Emperor remain strong, I do doubt the validity of some of these claims as their claims of soon being rescued come paired with a decrease in our rations, why cut down on rationing if we are so close to salvation?
