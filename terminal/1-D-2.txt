From: The Office of Gideon Cyneg
Mrs. Lugen,
We have reviewed your proposal for renewing your contract with the IoT and have found the statistics wanting. There is not sufficient data to support continuing this agreement in a way that is profitable for the Institute. We have decided that unless you can meet the required quota for sales by the time your current contract expires we will be canceling all further business arrangements with the company Omnicorp Tech. We advise you to embrace the Concordium to expand your sales. Pray to the Emperor for guidance and work harder to ensure you sell our product, even if you must do so at a personal loss. Sacrifice is a cornerstone of personal development.
Best of luck with your future sales Mrs. Lugen. Praise the Concordium and the Emperor.


Signed,
Gideon Cyneg, Chief Adept of the Skaelen-Har Institute of Technology Warrant of Trade Division
