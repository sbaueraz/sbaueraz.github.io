Whisper-Bolt Discharger:
 
Upgrades: Any non-Primitive ranged weapon

Las weapons, produced in countless billions by forges and manufactorums across the Imperium, are well designed for the large-scale battles that the Imperial Guard is constantly mired in. However, the lightning-like crack and bright beam of energy are very poorly suited for stealth and infiltration, and conventional blast and flash mufflers and silencers can't be used with a las weapon for obvious reasons. "Whisper-Bolts" are a type of modified lasgun produced by a few lesser manufactorums largely for use by mercenary companies and other "private" concerns - modification of an STC design is frowned upon at best and violently persecuted by the Adeptus Mechanicus at worst, so most stay well clear of such efforts. The modified discharger shifts the las-bolt out of the visible spectrum; combined with a noise dampener wrapping around the length of the barrel, a "Whisper-Bolt" is almost as difficult to observe as a silenced slug-thrower. The modified discharger does reduce the lasgun's overall power, however, making this upgrade more suitable for use in ambushes or infiltrations than open combat. A las weapon with a whisper-bolt discharger forces a -20 penalty on Awareness Tests to hear or spot the attack, and can only be attempted within the weapon's standard Range, though the las-bolts can still be seen by characters wearing IR goggles or holo-visors. Energy is lost in hiding the beam within the visible spectrum; reduce the weapon's Damage by 1.
