Vox Bug

This self-propelled listening device is essentially a miniaturised micro-bead's aural pickup and transmitter that has been fit into a mechanical body vaguely resembling a tiny beetle. The cortical material from ubiquitous hive-roaches makes up its basic intelligence functions - the vox bug can be told simple instructions, such as "climb into that woman's handbag" or "hide in the left corner of the next room", which it will carry out as best as its faculties permit. The bug can also be switched into an inert mode and then simply stuck under a shelf, behind a conduit box, or any other concealed location, in which case its tiny pincers latch on to an applicable perch and it remains in place. In all cases, the vox bug faithfully reproduces all noises that occur nearby, transmitting them to any micro-beads or voxcasters that are listening in on the correct frequency. The tiny transmitter can't apply encrypt-ciphers to its signal, so it is not unheard of for paranoid individuals to cycle through frequencies on a vox-caster when entering a room they suspect may be bugged. If a noisy feedback loop appears on a given channel, the concerned party will know his privacy has been compromised in the nearby area. A vox bug can move along the ground or any contiguous surface at a rate of 1 metre per Round. If it needs to hide, the vox bug can make Concealment Tests with an Agility of 60. The vox bug can transmit everything it hears just like a micro-bead, including the range limitations and the ability to trunk through a vox-caster. Because of its tiny size and mass, any kind of attack - especially being stepped on - ruins the tech-artifice entirely. A vox bug can transmit for up to a week before its power cell expires and must be recharged. Agents who need to have uninterrupted eavesdropping will often, circumstances permitting, wire the vox bug into an available power box or conduit to keep its cell fully charged, in which case it can theoretically operate forever.
