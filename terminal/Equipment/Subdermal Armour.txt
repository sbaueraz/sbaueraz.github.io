Subdermal Armour:

Agents, infiltrators, and others who rely on disguise and subterfuge often do not have the liberty of proper armour and protective gear when they most frequently change their attire and appearance. Subdermal armour can help rectify this by inserting thin plates of high density ceramite under the bearer's tissues, protecting bones and organs from a variety of physical violence. Great care must be taken by the chirurgeon performing the task, however, as all sorts of complications can arise from shody workmanship, such as skin losing circulation and rotting off or muscles becoming crushed by excess pressure. Likewise, only the absolute finest ceramite can be used in the forging of the armour plates themselves - fragments chipping and breaking off, ordinarily a superficial problem on a suit of power armour, can lead to infection, tumours, or even a fatal ischemia. Subdermal armour adds 2 APs to the character's Arms, Body, and Legs locations, which stack with any worn Armour. If properly installed, the armour can't be detected by visual observation and searches, but the plates will show up on an auspex scan.
