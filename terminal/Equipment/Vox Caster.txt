Vox-caster:

A vox-caster is an invaluable tool for longdistance communication. Typically just called a vox, this device translates the user's voice into a burst of radiation that can be received across the air by other vox-casters. Compared to a voxterminas (common equipment in many Imperial hive-cities) there is no need for voluminous cable conduits and mechanical switch-pits, leading to some - especially in military circles - to refer to the boxes as a "wireless". Vox-casters are somewhat temperamental pieces of tech filled with vacuum tubes and cable-spooled amplificator cells - causing one to reach out and connect to the proper recipient is a complex affair requiring a precise understanding of the vox's gauges and meters. Soldiers tasked with carrying a vox-caster must be trained in its use, typically receiving a specialist pay increase, while vehicles equipped with one often have a crewmember assigned to manipulate it. Portable vox-casters are often designed to be worn as a small backpack (this variety is typically encountered in military use), but less common varieties can be found built into a sturdy piece of luggage, the vox's operator unfolding the case to access the vox's controls and antenna. Depending on environmental conditions, such as ambient weather and the presence of large structures, a portable vox-caster can be used to communicate with other vox-casters up to 3,000 kilometres away. Larger vox units, such as those found in Imperial Guard vehicles, may have a range two or three times higher. In all cases, using a vox-caster requires a successful Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use Test, with failure indicating the character only hears static. Establishing a connection to a given frequency takes one minute, though this time can be reduced by ten seconds for every degree of success on the operator's Tech-Use Test. Once the initial contact has been made, subsequent activations take a Full Action.
