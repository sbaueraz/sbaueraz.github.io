Panimmune (Drug)
 
Panimmune is a powerful medicinal compound that gives the user a massive boost to their natural resistance against toxins, contamination, parasites, and other infectious agents, making it a highly sought-after item for explorers and travellers as well as enforcers and agents pursuing targets into foetid hiding spots. The drug takes the form of a disposable hypospray tube that administers the panimmune via a tiny high-pressure jet into the user's neck. The strong mixture of counterseptics and inert toxin-absorbing compounds can be a literal life- saver in situations where even light injuries or switching re-breather canisters can be fatal, but it is extremely dangerous to use over a long term period as the potent mixture can upset the user's bodily humours - possibly with fatal results. Panimmune should never be confused with painimmune - though similar in name, the effects are wholly different, and a mistake in dosage between the two could be catastrophic. Once injected a dose of panimmune immediately provides a +30 bonus on Toughness Tests made to withstand most poisons, diseases, toxins and infections. An unintended side effect, this bonus also applies to Carouse Tests as well. The effect lasts for 1d5+5 hours. Once the drug wears off, the user takes a - 10 penalty on the same Toughness Tests as their body's natural defences are somewhat weakened by the loss of the drug's fortifying effect. The user can re-dose immediately, but taking more than one dose without first having a full night's rest (about 8 hours) to allow their humours to "reset" can be perilous. In this case, the user must pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or permanently lose 1 point of Toughness and Willpower. Characters that do not sleep, such as heavily augmented Tech-Priests, may be active during this period as normal, though taking a second dose in any 8 hour period still has the same consequences.
