Tracking Device

This very simple homer is designed to be covertly planted within a target's effects and then used to follow the unsuspecting victim or his targeted item. This sort of tracking effort is  typically deployed as part of a larger strategy to use a compromised target to reveal the physical location of the ultimate quarry. Because this sort of endeavour usually indicates a high degree of sophistication, finding a tracking device in your luggage is sometimes enough of a fear-inducing discovery to shake those with a weaker will. The tracking device itself is only about the size of a single Throne Gelt, using adhesive or magnetic pads to attach itself to just about anything. The device gives off a low power vox signal on unused frequencies that can be interpreted by a special handheld locator about the size of an auspex. The locator indicates the rough direction and distance on a small pict-screen, leaving the operator to deal with structures and obstacles that might be in the way. The locator can pick up the tracking device's bearing from many kilometres away, but interference from built-up areas such as hive spires or giant manufactoria yards can drastically shorten the range to as little as a few hundred metres - this often necessitates fairly close pursuit. A tracking device can be planted covertlyusing Concealment or Sleight of Hand Tests as necessary. Once paired to a locator, the tracking device reports its direction and distance relative to the locator as best it can - the rest is up to the locator's operator. The device can be recovered and re-used simply by peeling it off from whatever it was attached to. Should the device or locator be lost, the tracking device itself has a base price of 50 Thrones while the locator's makes up the rest for the purposes of obtaining replacements. A locator can only track a single device at once.
