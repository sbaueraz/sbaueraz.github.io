Frenzon (Drug)
 
Unquestionably the top tier of combat drugs, frenzon sends the consumer into a violent rage,
making him a fanatical and fearless warrior who seeks only the destruction of his enemies. It is commonly used in military situations, especially among penal legions, where it has an infamous reputation due to the use of remote-controlled autoinjectors meant to "motivate" the dour legionnaires. Other users include high-rent mercenaries, bloodspot fighters, and ganger heavies that want to "feel the rush" while smashing some victim's head against the rockcrete. Frenzon is always used with an injector so as to provide immediate results. A character using frenzon enters into a rage one Round later as if he had the Frenzy talent, gaining all the benefits and penalties associated with being frenzied. This effect lasts for 1d5+5 minutes and may not be voluntarily ended by the consumer short of using de-tox or some similar effect.
