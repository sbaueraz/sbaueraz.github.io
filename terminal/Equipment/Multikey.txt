Multikey:

Though it is an honest utility item that is immediately useful for all matters of maintenance and social needs, a multikey is often thought of as a tool of burglary and theft. Many types of Imperial locks and security mechanisms work off of similar, or sometimes even identical, components and layouts - a multikey can interface with common patterns of mechanical and semi-mechanical locks, giving a skilled handler the ability to "finesse" a lock the rest of the way open. In an overbuilt habstack or industrial vault teeming with locked access hatches and cable-snake tunnels, a technomat armed with a multikey can be the difference between normal operations and functions grinding to a halt as block supervisors fumble through rotary files of keys and cards looking for the right one - they are also imminently useful for the salvation of citizens that have locked themselves out of their habs, and for the wealthier among them, personal vehicles. Of course, with the ability to open locks with relative ease using a metallic tool no bigger than a deck of cards, one can see how more paranoid citizens might believe a multikey holder could have less than honourable intentions as well. A character using a multi-key gains a +30 bonus to Security Tests made to open most types of Imperial locks. Rare, unusual, or superior types of locks may reduce this bonus or completely negate it altogether - in general, the user is aware of whether or not his multikey will be useful or not through quick visual inspection.
