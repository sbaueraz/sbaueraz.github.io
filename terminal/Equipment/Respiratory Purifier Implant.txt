Respiratory Purifier Implant:

Compared to a full bionic respiratory system, this implant is a fairly simple solution towards making the bearer's lungs more resistant to airborne toxins and noxious fumes. A specially devised porous membrane is grown in a culture vat and then sent down the bearer's windpipe with a tiny prehensile probe where it is attached to the interior lining of the lungs. Poisonous particles and vapours have a much harder time penetrating the membrane than the organs' original surfaces and most are destroyed by natural biotic reactions. With his lungs and windpipe so augmented, the bearer can head into a toxic environment with the same confidence as if he was wearing a gas mask. However, many will still choose to carry a mask anyway owing to certain gases and poisons being able to attack the eyes as well - something this implant has no power to address. A respiratory purifier implant grants a +20 bonus to Toughness Tests made to withstand airborne toxins and allows a re-roll of failed Tests. This bonus does not stack with that from a gas mask or respirator as the implant essentially places the same filters in the character's lungs. If the gas can affect the character's eyes or attacks the skin, the bonus decreases to +10. This implant is not effective against any gases that can bypass a gas mask (as noted in their description).
