Memorance Unit:

This metallic device is permanently grafted to the back of the bearer's skull where it wires directly into the memory centres of the brain and functions as a miniaturised datavault. Aside from being able to greatly enhance the bearer's ability to remember things, an exterior pictcapture array and compact projector are attached to the bearer's temples and connected to the memorance unit by thin cables to record and capture what the bearer sees. It can then be replayed for the benefit of an audience, allowing the bearer of the implant to share his memories with others directly. This augmetic is most commonly employed by archivists and chroniclers, though scholars and other seekers of knowledge will sometimes petition for the device, whether for research or simple posterity. Much less common, though undeniably effective and with a suitable flare for the dramatic, are those who would use a memorance unit as an aid in negotiations. Potentially damaging or critical information, captured from the perspective of the augmetic's bearer, can be an excellent source of leverage in such encounters. A memorance unit grants a +20 bonus to Trade (Remembrancer) Tests as well as the Total Recall talent if the character did not already possess it. If the character already has the talent, he instead never needs to make an Intelligence Test to recollect information that the memorance unit has captured. Should the character already have cybernetic eyes or a similar bionic sense he may omit the pictcapture array and simply capture all that he sees with his augmetic oculars.
