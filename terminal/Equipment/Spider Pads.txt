Spider Pads:

Spider pads are a type of superior climbing apparatus that are worn on the hands, arms, knees and feet. At the wearer’s direction, these unusual-looking pads can emit an adhesive substance that greatly improves the wearer’s ability to climb sheer surfaces, giving them spider-like mobility where others would be struggling to find purchase. Care must be taken to ensure that the spider pads themselves remain inactive when the wearer isn’t climbing lest they find themselves sticking to floors, walls and held objects, and most only don these items when about to begin a climb. A character wearing spider pads gains a +30 bonus to Climb Tests when attempting to climb most regular surfaces. Loose and unstable surfaces, such as scree or talus, reduce this bonus to +10.
