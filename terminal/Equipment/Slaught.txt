Slaught:

Short for "onslaught", this drug powerfully affects the consumer's nervous and respiratory system, making them both physically and mentally faster. Slaught is most commonly used in military situations where a final push or fierce attack is about to be launched - troops under its effect can cross enemy kill zones and other types of "no man's land" much quicker, giving them a better chance of making it to their objective and unleashing the Emperor's fury upon the enemy. Extended use of slaught can badly overtax the consumer's vital humours and innards, often resulting in nerve damage or growth of tumours. Most commanders will not issue it regularly for this reason, although depending on the conflict, a Guardsman could well have much bigger things to worry about than possible long-term consequences. Its use outside of the Imperial Guard and other armed forces is fairly rare. Slaught can be ingested or injected directly into the bloodstream - injecting it results in more immediate effect but tends to have side effects once the drug runs its course. Slaught takes one minute to become effective after being ingested. If injected instead the drug takes only one Round to take effect. Regardless of how it is taken, a dose of slaught increases the user's Agility and Perception by +30 for 3d10 Rounds, during which time the user feels extraordinarily jumpy and restless if he isn't engaged in some type of physical activity. Once the drug wears off the user must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or suffer a level of Fatigue as his body catches up with the drug's effects and leaves him exhausted. If the character injected slaught the difficulty of the Test becomes Difficult (-10) with failure inflicting 1d5 levels of Fatigue. Failure by three or more degrees also reduces the user's Agility by 1d5 points - if the user injected slaught, this Characteristic Damage is permanent.
