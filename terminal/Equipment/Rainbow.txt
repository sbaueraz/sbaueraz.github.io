Rainbow (Drug)
 
So named for the all-encompassing spectrum of treatments contained, rainbow is an advanced drug concoction meant to be used in life-or- death situations where a more specific treatment can't be diagnosed in a timely basis. Rainbow contains numerous individual medicinals, including anti-allergen compounds, anti- bacterial serum, blood-clotting agents, poison antidotes, antirad chemicals, broad-band immune stimulators, a whole slew of vitamins, and a potent sedative - the latter most ingredient often jabbed at as being included "just because". The sheer amount of bio-reactive substances being injected at once can cause massive system shock to the victim - as a result, rainbow is typically only used as a drug of last resort or where a medicae must take a gamble when fighting an unknown ailment. Rainbow is so powerful that the drug is actually referenced in Administratum code as part of the Lex Medicae.- officially, rainbow cannot be administered without the victim's consent. Of course, this is rarely enforced outside of established hospices and convalescent sanatoriums as critical emergencies are the very reason for the drug's use in the first place. After being injected with a dose of rainbow, a victim can immediately re-roll any Toughness Tests to resist most diseases and toxins, withsuccess ending any ongoing effects, though it does not reverse existing conditions or Damage already taken. If the character is suffering from Blood Loss that condition ends as well. At the same time, the character must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test. Success causes them to gain a single level of Fatigue, while failure inflicts 1d5 levels as well as 1d5 points of Damage that ignores Armour and Toughness. Note that the character is subjected to this secondary effect regardless of whether or not the dose helped them overcome an existing condition or ailment.
