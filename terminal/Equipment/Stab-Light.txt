Stab-light:

This handheld device is designed to project a sharp, coherent beam of light out to a considerable distance, allowing its wielder to banish darkness from a specified point of aim. Compared to a lamp pack, a stab-light is smaller and handier with a greater effective range, but it can only illuminate a fairly small area. Stablights come in a variety of sizes, ranging from small pocket units that fit nicely in the hand to sturdy femur-sized metal rods that can double nicely as a truncheon. Stab-lights typically run off of cheap disposable power cells that feed a high-lumen gas bulb protected by a thin layer of transparent plastek or armaglass, and, depending on the shape and function, may include an adjustable focus function too. A stab-light can throw a beam of bright whitish-yellow light up to 50 metres away. The light can be projected as a straight line or cone, though the total diameter of the illuminated area cannot exceed more than about five metres. A stab light's power cells last for 1d5+1 hours of continuous use before they run down and must be discarded - replacement power cells have a base price of 1 Throne and are Plentiful on most developed worlds.
