Diagnostor/Medispex
 
A diagnostor - also known as a medicae
auspex, or medispex in shorthand - is something
of a highly advanced tox-wand, though such a
comparison belittles the diagnostor's very
sophisticated faculties. A diagnostor broadly
resembles a pistol-type weapon, but its muzzle
only houses several types of multi-spectrum
analysers and sniffers that use a combination of
harmless ion radiation, sono-imaging, and
precision chem-detectors to identify and
diagnose a bewildering array of pathogens,
poisons, and bio-hazards that a victim may be
suffering from. The results are presented on a
small screen integrated on the back of the
device's housing, along with any suggested
remedies that may be available. Diagnostors are
armed with the breadth of ailments and
afflictions known to Imperial medicae scholars -
it has been said that anyone who manages to
turn up an "unknown" result on a medispex will
likely have the privilege of naming the condition
they've just discovered, though this will likely be
of little comfort to the victim.
A diagnostor can be used to identify almost
any condition or malady a victim may be
suffering from. Using a diagnostor is a Full
Action, after which the user must make an Easy
(+30) Medicae Test - any success identifies
what's causing the victim's infirmity as well as
what countermeasures can be taken (a grim
conclusion of "Prayer" is provided if there is no
known cure or remedy). If the user fails the Test
the diagnostor is unable to identify exactly what
is causing the victim's condition, though it still
provides suggestions to treat the ongoing
symptoms if not the cause itself.
