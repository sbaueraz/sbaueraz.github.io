Calculus Logi Implant:

Miniaturised cogitator cylinders that pump a liquid data medium are wired directly into the bearer's brain, greatly expanding thought processing centres and literally letting him "think faster". A calculus logi implant is of immense utility for archivists and scholars, making sifting through towering stacks of dataslates and rolls of parchment seem far less daunting. However, the bearer's improved mental processing can have potentially undesirable side effects, such as spontaneously completing other people's sentences or chronic insomnia. Unlike some mind-enhancing augmetics, a calculus logi can be shut off when the bearer is not in need of its assistance, though its machine spirit can be notably perturbed by this and may gift the bearer with a migraine when reconnected. A calculus logi implant grants the bearer a +10 bonus on all Logic, Literacy, and Lore Tests made against written or textual materials. If the character has the Total Recall talent, it also grants these bonuses to the character's memories as well. The implant makes it more difficult for the bearer to sleep when it is active - the GM is free to determine what effects, if any, this has in the game. The implant can be switched off to negate this effect, but the bearer must succeed on a Routine (+20) Willpower Test or gain one level of Fatigue due to headaches the next time he activates the implant.
