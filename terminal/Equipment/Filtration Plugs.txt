Filtration Plugs:

Filtration plugs are simple but exceedingly useful items that are inserted into the wearer’s nostrils. The expansive foam or fabric material fills the orifices, helping to ward off dangerous vapours (as well as unpleasant odours). Filtration plugs are commonly employed by workers who deal with the more foul aspects of Imperial society, such as tanners, sump crews, morticians, and grox herders, but can also be used to protect against some chemical weapons in a pinch. A character wearing filtration plugs gains a +20 bonus to any Toughness Test made to resist the effects of gases.
