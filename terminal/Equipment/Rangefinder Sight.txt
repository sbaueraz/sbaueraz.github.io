Rangefinder Sight:

Upgrades: Any Basic or Heavy Las, Solid Projectile, Bolt, Plasma, or Launcher weapon

Rangefinders are most commonly encountered in the targeting apparatuses of Imperial tanks, but smaller and less powerful versions exist to equip man-portable weapons as well. Most ranged weapons are lethal well beyond the distance at which they can be fired with even the thinnest margin of a successful hit; a rangefinder sight combines the magnification of a telescopic sight with the ballistic calculance cogitator stacks of a targeter with the sole purpose of making those hits possible. By aggregating atmospheric pressure, wind speed, the trajectory characteristics of the weapon, and a host of other esoteric and arcane measures, a rangefinder scope can guide the shooter to making truly heroic shots. This application is of particular use to military snipers as well as hunters tracking the most dangerous and savage of death world game, but heavy weapons teams in fixed positions can also make use of this
assistance to rain death on attacking enemy forces even longer. A character using a rangefinder sight must spend 3 Action Points to Aim to obtain its benefits. Any Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack benefitting from the Aim ignores the normal penalties for Long and Extreme range; furthermore, its Extreme range increases to five times the weapon's listed Range, rather than the usual four. The shooter can passively use the rangefinder sight to determine the exact distance of any target he Aims at. A rangefinder sight counts towards a gunâ€™s one sight limit.
