Grapnel

When you need to reach a vertically distant area or object, a grapnel is often the quickest and easiest way to make the ascent. The most common examples used on developed worlds (and by explorers on regional backwaters) take the form of a crossbow or gas-gun with a metallic frame that fires a hooked or magnetic anchor trailing a long length of wire (most have a spool that will go about 100 metres). Once the grapnel has secured itself to the desired location, the firer can climb the line or winch himself up using the grapnel's own spool mechanism. Grapnels are commonly thought of as being a  tool for explorers blazing trails through perilous feral jungles and mountains, but they are just as commonly used by manufactorum workers to ascend tall gantries or the support ribbing of industrial vaults, while particularly bold recidivists (and assassins...) have been more rarely known to use a grapnel to make their way up the exterior of hive spires, sometimes for several levels or more, to reach an exposed balcony or window belonging to their target. Firing a grapnel does not require a Test unless the user wishes to hit a specific target, such as a single outcropping, pipe, or window ledge, in which case the user makes a Ballistic Skill Test which can benefit from the Aim Action. A grapnel has a range of 50m but cannot be fired at Long or Extreme Range, giving it a maximum range of 100m. A character can climb the extended cable, but the difficulty of the Climb Test is one step higher than if they were using knotted rope due to the smoothness of the cable. The grapnel's user can also employ the winch to ascend, in which case he can reel himself up at a rate of 5 metres per Round. No Tests are necessary to climb in this way, though the user must keep both hands on the grapnel unless he is using it in conjunction with a clip/drop harness.
