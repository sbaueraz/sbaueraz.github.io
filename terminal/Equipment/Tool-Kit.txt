Tool Kit:

This pressed alloy box contains a small arsenal of handheld tools meant for basic repair and maintenance work on many types of hardware. Common equipment includes several types of pilers and tongs, wire snips, screw and bolt drivers, wrenches, insulated clamps, and a small hammer. Invariably included are one or more rolls of adhesive "mud tape" (so named because it sticks to everything and never comes off), which is considered by many to be a gift from the Mechanicus due to its ability to rejoin almost any mechanical component that has separated from its proper location.
