Gene-Printer

A gene-printer is a fairly sophisticated apparatus that uses a small battery of logis stacks combined with sensitive sniffer-fibres that can closely compare samples of gene-spoor (hair follicles, skin, bodily fluids, and so forth) to determine if they are from the same source. The Adeptus Arbites and their skilled verispex adepts make heavy use of these devices to secure evidence of guilt from the persecuted - criminals and recidivists have decried the reliability of such arcane methods, though the Lord Marshal Goreman has insistently defended their accuracy and even-handedness. Aside from the blackarmoured Arbitrators, well-funded enforcer cadres, such as Scintilla's Magistratum, also equip themselves with these tools of justice. A gene-printer is fully self-contained, requiring no external connections to process its information, and is compact enough to be stuffed into a backpack and carried in the field, which allows for quick analysis and conviction of the guilty without the need to return to an enforcer house or precinct-fort. Using a gene-printer requires a successful Ordinary (+20) Tech-Use Test. Two samples of gene-spoor are placed in individual trays and taken into the gene-printer where it performs its analysis and conclusions - the process takes about 1d5 minutes. Any success confirms what relationship, if any, the gene-spoor samples have to one another, while failure indicates an inconclusive result. Failure by three or more degrees does the same but also ruins both samples as the gene-printer's machine spirit becomes irate. While effective for most cases, providing samples of exceptionally strange genespoor, such as heavily mutated creatures or xenos beings, can have unpredictable effects.
