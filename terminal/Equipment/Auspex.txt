Auspex/Scanner

"Auspex" is a general term for a category of sensor and scanning devices that can detect energy emissions, motion and movement, and
biological life signs. Auspex units come in a range of sizes, with smaller types being able to fit in a modest belt pouch with a wire connection to a wrist- or visor-mounted display while heavier vehicular models might be the size of a man's torso. Larger auspex units generally have a greater scanning distance and can more easily detect hidden objects. Though imminently useful during exploration and scouting endeavours, an auspex must be carefully manipulated in order to achieve the desired effect - a unit whose machine spirit is not adequately mollified will often report the presence of nonexistent objects or threats. Common handheld auspex units take the form of a single housing about the size of a large dataslate or a two-piece affair with a cable-connected display. An auspex can be used in an automatic scan mode or can be manually activated to do more intensive examination of the area. In automatic mode, an auspex grants the user a +20 bonus to Opposed Awareness Tests against other characters or creatures using the Concealment Skill or benefitting from environmental concealment such as smoke or brush. In manual mode, the user must succeed on an Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use Test, with success revealing the presence of living creatures, moving objects, the presence of most types of weapons, and potentially other hidden dangers such as radiation or toxic gases in the air. Should the user fail his Test, the auspex may return a partial result, nothing at all, or "false positives" as it identifies threats that don't actually exist. A handheld auspex typically has a range of about 50 metres, though walls more than 50 centimetres thick, special shielding materials, and background interference from heavy machinery or dedicated jamming equipment can degrade or totally block an auspex's scanning.
