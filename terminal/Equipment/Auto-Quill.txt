Auto-Quill:

An esoteric though undoubtedly useful device, auto-quills are a boon to adepts and anyone else who must deal with written records for any period of time. Auto-quills typically take the form of small metallic or wooden cabinets large enough to feed reams of paper or rolls of parchment through, with a runeboard or keypad attached to one end not unlike a personal cogitator. The other end feeds the paper in where one or two pairs of small servo-arms convert the user's keystrokes into written words and prose on the chosen medium. Using an auto-quill requires some training before useful copies and prints can be made - the user must become very judicious in his finger-tapping as an auto-quill happily duplicates errors just as well, and there are a handful of minor rites that must be observed before using the device in order to ensure reliable transfer. Once a user has "gotten the stroke of it", however, many wonder how they wrote at all before using one. A character using an autoquill gains a +10 bonus to Trade (Copyist) Tests in any situation where the written material can be used with an auto-quill. A Good Craftsmanship auto-quill grants a +20 bonus as well as producing written text that will fool all but the most discerning eye into thinking it was written by hand.
