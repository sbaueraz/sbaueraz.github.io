Internal Blade:

An augmetic that is almost more of the fleshsculptor's art than anything else, this incredibly precise and finely fitted device is inserted into the muscles and tissues of the bearer's lower arm where it can be used to perfectly conceal a small bladed melee weapon. A skin vent on the wrist allows the weapon to be drawn, typically hiltfirst, so the augmetic tends to be implanted in the bearer's non-dominant arm. The mechanism itself, resembling an almost paper-thin brace weapon's base, is invariably made of high quality monoplasteks so it does not appear on an auspex scan, likewise concealing the weapon until the moment it is drawn. Great care must be taken when returning the blade to its augmetic sheath, as a slight error in angling the point can result in missing the skin vent and instead piercing flesh, or worse, arteries in the wrist. An internal blade can store most bladed knives and similar weapons - including power blades - in a hidden augmetic in the character's arm. The weapon can be drawn normally, but slipping it back in requires a Full Action. The implant's base price does not include that of the weapon itself, which must be acquired separately. What melee weapons can be used with this implant are left to the GM's discretion.
