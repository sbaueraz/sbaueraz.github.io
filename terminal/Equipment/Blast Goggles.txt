Blast Goggles:

This bulky eyewear is specifically designed for protective purposes, most commonly taking the form of large, single lens pieces that are strapped to the back of the wearer’s head. The heavy glassteel lens is durable enough to deflect or mitigate flying bits of shrapnel, making them popular items for those who fight at close quarters, and also includes a reactive laminate coating that darkens in response to bright flashes of light. Aside from combat applications, blast goggles are also common attire for forge workers, furnace crews, and arc torch operators. They can also be found in use by gangers who value the intimidating look as well as the degree of concealment offered by the hefty pieces. A character wearing blast goggles is immune to the blinding effects of a photon flash grenade and similar sources of extremely bright light, though the character suffers a -10 penalty to sight-based Awareness tests for 1d5 Rounds as the laminated lens returns to its normal transparency. Additionally, should the character ever be subjected to a non-Energy Critical Damage effect that would cause him to lose one or both eyes, the goggles save his eyesight but are torn away and ruined in the process.
