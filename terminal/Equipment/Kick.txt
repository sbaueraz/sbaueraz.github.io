Kick (Drug)

Kick is the common name for a variety of drugs that give the user a sharp burst of short- lived energy. Though not nearly as potent as slaught or most types of stimms there are also fairly few consequences to its use besides a profound feeling of tiredness once the drug wears off. Unlike many drugs, kick includes a biological "warning" to the user when its effects are about to expire. When the user begins to see unusual colours around the edges of their vision he knows that he'll soon be plunged into profound listlessness and lethargy. Kick is commonly used in military situations where an urgent manoeuvre must be executed no matter what condition the troops are in, but it can also be found in the pockets of warring hive-gangers and enforcer kill teams who believe a little extra "kick" might be the margin of victory. Kick's low cost and ease of manufacture makes it available to just about anyone who can find a seller, though it typically has few users outside of those who make their living through violence. A dose of kick becomes effective one Round after it is injected and remains active for 1d5+10 Rounds. During this time the user can completely ignore the effects of any Fatigue he already has as well as additional levels he may gain while the drug is effective. Once the drug wears off the user falls back under the effects of any accumulated Fatigue he already has plus an additional two levels, which may be enough to render him unconscious. If the user had no Fatigue when he injected kick, he instead gains 1d5 levels when it wears off. A character who has used kick is aware that the drug will wear off one Round before it actually does.
