Stummer:

Stummers are almost standard kit for professional infiltrators and saboteurs, and are also well used by assassins, military snipers, and others who place a high value on stealth. Most would say that a stummer somehow absorbs noise made by its user, but the reality is somewhat more complex. The oblong object is about the size of a howler grenade and features about a dozen holes at regular intervals through which glimpses of thin fibre-like wires can be obtained. Once activated, a stummer issues a variable "anti-noise" that cancels out most sound-waves created by the wearer. Using a stummer to maximum effect requires some skill at moving in a certain way, but trained skulkers can become nearly inaudible while under one's effects. The basic technology behind a stummer is frequently used for acoustic isolation of heavy machinery, making obtaining spare parts for one relatively easy on developed worlds. As long as it is worn in an exposed position, a stummer provides a +30 bonus to Silent Move Tests. A stummer can be switched on or off as a Half Action, and its power cell provides enough energy for up to 20 minutes of usage. The cell can be recharged in about an hour through most common Imperial power sources - alternatively, the user can swap out a spare power cell, which takes a Full Action. Power cells compatible with a stummer have a base price of 2 Thrones and are Abundant on most developed worlds.
