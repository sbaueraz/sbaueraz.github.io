Syrette:
 
Simple to a point, this type of injector
uses a thin needle attached to a tube that
contains the drug. Pressure, whether by
squeezing the tube or pressing down on a
plunger, forces the drug into the recipient's flesh.
Syrettes are cheap and effective, but have to be
used on an area of bare skin, making them
somewhat clumsy in dangerous situations (such
as combat). A syrette is typically thrown away
after being used, though some types can be
refilled and used again. Re-used syrettes are
commonly seen in the employ of addicts of illicit
drugs, and can often lead to infections. For the
same reason, a syrette can be dangerous if used
in a contaminated environment - most medics,
given enough time, will sanitise the injection site
with alcohol or a similar disinfectant first. Using
a drug with a syrette is a Full Action.
