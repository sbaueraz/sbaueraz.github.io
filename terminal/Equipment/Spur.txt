Spur:

This drug is most commonly used by unsavoury types who earn their keep through violence. It is highly unusual in its method of action in that the initial effect is delayed - the strong stimulants and proteins remain inert in the user's bloodstream until they are activated by adrenaline, at which time the user is hit by an abrupt rush of energy and vigour. Because of these qualities, a user can "dose up" in anticipation of violence, saving them from fumbling with an injector or skin patch while a foe is drawing weapons. A spur user can endure almost any pain or injury, fighting through wounds or exhaustion that would leave an unassisted man on the ground wheezing for mercy. Overusing spur invariably causes addiction, however, adding another la ready present in a fight. A dose of spur takes one Round to become active, but it does not actually take effect until the user becomes engaged in combat. Spur can remain in the user's body for up to 10 hours - if the user does not engage in combat during this time the drug dissipates and another dose must be taken in order to gain its effects. Once a character enters into combat (rolls Initiative or Surprises an enemy) the drug becomes effective for 2d10 minutes. A character under the effect of spur cannot be Stunned or take any levels of Fatigue while the drug is effective. Once the effect ends the user suffers a -20 penalty to any Toughness- or Agility-based Tests for one hour. The user also gains one level of Fatigue for every two levels that he ignored due to taking spur (if the character ignored one level of Fatigue then he takes none when the spur wears off). Taking more than five doses of spur in a weeklong period can cause addiction - the character must succeed on a Hard (-20) Willpower Test to fight it off. Failure indicates that the user succumbs to deranged paranoia, compulsively dosing up every day out of fear that he will be without it.
