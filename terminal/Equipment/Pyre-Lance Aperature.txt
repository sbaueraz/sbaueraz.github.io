Pyre-Lance Aperture:

Upgrades: Any Melta weapon other than Mars pattern weapons

A favoured modification by the Orders Militant of the Adepta Soroitas as well as the best-equipped Redemptionist fanatics, a pyre lance aperture adds extra focusing emitters to the barrel and muzzle of most common meltaguns, giving a more focused blast that can extend the reach of these staggeringly powerful weapons out to a more meaningful distance. The baroque, brazier-like pyre-lance creates a very dramatic appearance as well, keeping up with the aesthetics and fearsome look that the Sisters of Battle prefer. However, the modified aperture is woefully inefficient with the weaponâ€™s fuel supply, burning off a substantial amount of the chemical admixture for several seconds after every firing and further reinforcing the incendiary appearance. The well-equipped Orders Militant typically do not have any difficulty keeping up the flow of supplies, while Redemption Cultists rarely get into the sort of intense, pitched battles that would leave them with impressive-looking clubs. The same cannot be said for most Imperial Guard regiments and legions, however, so this modification can be considered a strictly "non-military" upgrade. Melta weapons outfitted with a pyre-lance aperture increase their Range by 10 metres but halve the Clip size due to horribly wasteful (though visually stunning) use of fuel. The threatening yet elegant appearance of a melta weapon modified by this upgrade grants a +10 bonus to Intimidate Skill Tests in anytime the weapon has been fired in the previous Round.
