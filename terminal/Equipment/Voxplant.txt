Voxplant:

Visible as a small plate behind the bearer's ear, a voxplant is a short-range communicator roughly similar to a micro-bead but with the added boon of being implanted in their head. A voxplant is thus never in danger of coming loose, being accidentally forgotten somewhere, and so forth. Voxplants are most commonly encountered on the crew of voidships to ensure they don't become tangled up and lost in bundles of cabling or on the edges of maintenance passages, and they are often linked directly to the ship's vox channels for ease of use. Aside from being always accessible, a voxplant is also completely inaudible to anyone except the bearer. internal pickup translates the movements of the bearer's mouth and throat into voice for listeners on the other end of the vox-link. This feature allows those "in the know" to produce speech simply by manipulating the muscles of their throat and tongue, making no audible noise but coming through crystal-clear on the voxplant. This technique, popularly known as "subvocalisation", is of particular use to infiltrators, agents, and voidsmen saying rude things behind an officer's back. A voxplant duplicates the effects of a Good Craftsmanship micro-bead. For twice the listed cost, it may also include the code ciphers of a Best Craftsmanship micro-bead as well.
