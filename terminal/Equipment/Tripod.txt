Tripod:

Upgrades: Any Heavy weapon

A tripod is a large and sturdy three-legged mount commonly used by Imperial Guard heavy weapon teams. A tripod attaches to a weapon’s centre of gravity and allows the wielder to turn it
in any direction, a handy feature for use in defensive positions such as dugouts and pillboxes. Because of their bulk and that they do not offer any benefits until the weapon is set
down, a tripod is usually carried separately by an assistant, with the gunner planting the weapon down via a mag-lock onto the tripod’s central shaft after reaching a suitable point.
Bracing with a tripod is 3 Action Points. Once Braced, the firer may attack any target within a 180-degree arc of his position.
