Backpack Ammo Pack:
  
Upgrades: Most non-primitive ranged weapons
  
Most ranged weapons store their ammunition in clips, canisters or packs attached to the weapon itself, but for extended battles or situations where the user doesn’t want to reload, a large external supply can be carried in a backpack. A backpack ammo pack employs a powered feed for projectiles or a cable supply for other sources that plugs into the weapon’s loading port, keeping a steady supply of ammunition ready to be fired at the wearer’s foes. Because of its bulk, backpack ammo packs are often employed by fighters wearing power armour, but a brawny trooper can muscle one along if need be. A backpack ammo pack is the size of a normal backpack, but has half of its volume given over to ammunition storage and a feed mechanism. Most las, solid projectile, bolt, melta, plasma, and flame weapons can be used with a backpack ammo pack. Grenades and rockets used by launchers are too large for any sort of meaningful feed line, and exotic weapons in general are varied to such an extent that trying to make a backpack ammo pack for one would be a tech-nightmare in and of itself. Some weapons, such as man-portable lascannons, already include an external ammunition or power source and cannot benefit from this upgrade. Unless otherwise stated, a backpack ammo pack can provide sufficient ammo for 300 shots for las weapons (high-powered hellguns and hellpistols consume this more quickly), 80 shots for plasma and melta weapons, 200 shots for bolt and solid projectile weapons, and 60 shots for flame weapons. Note that some weapons may not be compatible with a backpack ammo pack in spite of their type, often due to design considerations. Creating a backpack ammo pack for a stub revolver, for example, would likely be impossible.
