Bio-Power Cells:

This implant is broadly similar, though far smaller and less powerful, to the potentia coils borne by tech-priests and enginseers of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Flat power cells about the size of a coin are implanted throughout the bearer's body where they are partly subsumed by muscles and other tissues, leaving only a faint outline or small raised areas where thin wires connect them to betray their presence. These advanced cells slowly absorb bio-energy from the bearer's body, building up a charge that can be used for a variety of useful purposes when released from a small port or contact point implanted on the palms or fingertips. The energy released is not nearly strong enough to be used as a weapon, though it could certainly give a sharp jolt that would leave its victim tingling for an hour or so. The intended role of this augmetic is to make sure the bearer is never left suffering for lack of a quick power charge, such as to repower a data-slate with an expired energy cell, but more than a few eccentric nobles and others with gelt to burn have received this implant for no other reason than to offer a shocking surprise to their peers and guests who were only expecting a cordial handshake. Bio-power cells duplicate the effects of a pair of thermal gloves, though they do not offer any protection from extreme heat or cold.
