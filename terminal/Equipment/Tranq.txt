Tranq:

An unusual type of booze to say the least, this brew (if it can be called as such) is indigenous to the low hives of worlds in the Golgenna Reach, but press-ganged ratings and hard-nosed security proctors aboard voidships have spread it throughout the Calixis Sector. The exact method of preparation varies from recipe to recipe, but all involve a variety of chemical distillates being mixed and prepared into a drink that produces a feeling of numbing relaxation which lasts for hours. This tranquilising effect, which begets the stuff's name, is a welcome escape for many who eek out a paltry existence doing drudging work, though those who are used to the drunkenness that amasec or rotgut creates have referred to tranq's own inebriation as being remarkably depressing. The flavour varies widely depending on its individual constitution, with a few being regarded as "not disagreeable".
