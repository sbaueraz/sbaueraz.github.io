Forearm Weapon Mounting:

Upgrades: Any Pistol or Basic weapon (see text)

A heavy bracing replaces the upgraded weapon’s trigger and grip, allowing it to be fixed along the line of the user’s forearm. A special cable-attached glove is provided to control the
weapon’s functions and triggering. This arrangement keeps the wielder’s hands free, allowing them to use other weapons or perform fine manipulation while keeping their attached
weapon ready to be used at a moment’s notice. The weapon is usually turned on its axis with the clip positioned straight up or towards the wielder’s body to assist in reloading. It also
creates a strong visual impression as bolts, flame or plasma blasts seem to erupt from the user’s outstretched arm. A weapon fitted to a forearm weapon mounting’s range is reduced by 30% but otherwise functions normally and is always considered Readied. Pistol class weapons can be used by anyone in a forearm weapon mounting.
