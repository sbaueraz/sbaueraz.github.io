Calamity Vent:

Upgrades: Plasma weapons

These emergency cut-offs are carefully installed into the capacitance rings of plasma weapons and are designed to activate if a dangerous overload is detected by a small
cogitator unit. Instead of dumping heat into the weapon’s housing, often causing injury to the firer, the calamity vents cause it to be harmlessly expelled in a gout of searing blue flame away from the firer’s hands and body. When they function as designed, a calamity vent gives the plasma weapon’s wielder a surprise but nothing else, the overheat dissipated and weapon ready to be used again. However, these intrusions do not sit well with the machine spirits of most plasma weapons, and a mishap with one can be worse than if the weapon had been allowed to overheat in the first place. If a plasma weapon with calamity vents overheats, roll 1d10. On a roll of "4" or higher, the vents function as designed and the plasma is jettisoned safely. This attack is simply treated as a miss, and the weapon does not need to spend a round cooling off. On a "2" or "3", however, the overheat is still vented away, but it goes directly into the wielder’s face instead! Resolve this as if the wielder was shot by the plasma weapon, including the normal Damage and Penetration values; the wayward blast hits the wielder in the body unless they had used the Aim action just before the overheat, in which case it hits them in the head. On a result of "1", the vents have caused a catastrophic feedback loop and the plasma weapon violently explodes; treat this as though the weapon had rolled maximum Damage with a Blast of 3. The wielder cannot attempt an Agility Test to avoid the blast.
