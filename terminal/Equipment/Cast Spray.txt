Cast Spray
 
As the name suggests, this handy metallic can contains an aerosol spray that hardens into a
sturdy and impact-resistant mass suitable for bracing a broken bone. The spray is also laced with procoagulants and antibacterial agents which help greatly in preventing infection in perilous compound fractures. Cast spray is frequently added to medikits to improve the capability of the medic to treat broken bones, but can also be carried and used by itself as its application is fairly intuitive. A medic using cast spray allows the victim of a broken bone to roll twice and choose the more favourable result when making the Toughness Test to retain the limb (see Dark Heresy, page 211 for more information on Broken Limbs and their treatment). It also provides a +20 bonus to any Tests made to stop Blood Loss, though it may leave the character partly immobilised even if they don't have a broken bone at all. One can of cast spray is sufficient for three applications, after which it is usually discarded. Using cast spray is 3 Action Points.
