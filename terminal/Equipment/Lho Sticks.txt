Lho-Sticks
 
This popular narcotic is typically sold in packs and can be found just about anywhere within the Imperium, though some xeno-arcanists have suggested that even the lesser races of the galaxy make use of similar substances. Lho-sticks are formed from a thin paper that is rolled into a tube and filled with dried and crushed leaves from a variety of plants (referred to as a whole as "lho" in Administratum regulations) that produce a mildly relaxing and satisfying sensation when smoked. The lho smoke has some addictive qualities, and heavy users tend to develop a dependency on it after long term consumption. Lho-sticks sometimes incorporate a small foam filter to enhance the flavour and smoothness by reducing the amount of irritating particulates in the smoke. Regardless of their construction, lho-sticks are generally considered a recreational item on most worlds and their use is sometimes even encouraged among teeming masses of menials, labourers, low-hivers and enforcers as their sale typically brings in a few demi-Thrones to the planetary coffers. There are some worlds which strictly regulate or outright ban the consumption or sale of lho-sticks, however, as more than a few pilgrims and explorers have found out the hard way. Guardsmen tend to be especially heavy consumers, and their use is so common in the Imperial Guard that the Departmento Munitorum has even distributed their own brand (where it is inexplicably listed as a ration).
