Igniter:

Whether it is used for starting a campsite fire, re-lighting a snuffed pilot flame in a boiler or cooker, destroying sensitive information written on paper, or simply to start off a relaxing lho-stick, the ability to carry fire in one's pocket is an immediate distinction between advanced and feral worlds in the Imperium. Igniters are the chosen form on most developed Imperial worlds as they exhibit key qualities of ease of use, cheapness of manufacture, and reliability of action. Most igniters take the form of a small metallic or plastek box with or without a lid or cap that makes use of a flammable liquid fuel or Promethium aerosol to create a stable flame. The make and style vary widely on individual worlds, much less an entire sector of space, and some aficionados have been known to amass staggering collections of all shapes and sizes. Depending on the style, an igniter may require the user to keep a stud orswitch depressed to produce flame, or it may continue to burn until snuffed or its fuel is exhausted.
