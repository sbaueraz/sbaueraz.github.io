Bionic Cardiac System:

Disease, injury, or decadence can all damage or destroy a man's heart and arteries, and no matter how good of physical shape the body might be in, it will wither and die without adequate flow of life-giving blood. A bionic cardiac system can partly or fully replace the bearer's heart and major arteries with a strong mechanical replacement and vat-grown tissues for the finer bits, ensuring that whatever frailty eventually claims them most certainly won't be an infarction. The sturdy heart itself is typically mounted in a solid brace that attaches to the bearer's ribcage to prevent the device from pressing on other organs, and small metal plates may be visible on the bearer's chest to indicate the anchoring points, one of which will typically have a data-port to verify the heart's vitals. Aside from this reinforcement, the cardiac system's efficient pumping and oxygen infusers can improve the bearer's athletic ability as well, though care must be taken not to overstress the body - overeager users have been know to catastrophically damage the other areas of their circulatory system, including causing cranial haemorrhaging and other unpleasantness.  A bionic cardiac system grants the bearer the Sprint talent, though overuse of it causes the bearer to gain two levels of Fatigue instead of the usual one. Additionally, the installation and mounting strengthens the upper torso, granting 1 AP to the Body location that stacks with armour worn. A Good Craftsmanship system fully conceals itself under the wearer's flesh with no obvious plates or raised areas, and can also release bio-coagulants into the bloodstream if the bearer is suffering from Blood Loss. This is a passive effect that reduces the character's chance to die each Round to 5%.
