Cranial Reinforcement:

A man's head is a frighteningly fragile thing, containing his most important organs in a very small area. Having a limb taken off or torso crush, while life-threatening, may be a survivable injury, and with the aid of augmetics the victim could even be restored to full ability. Losing one's head, however, is virtually always instantly fatal. Imperial medicae frequently make use of composite and alloy bracing to help repair a damaged cranium, but this augmetic goes significantly further and replaces vast areas of the skull's osseous portions with a multilayered plasteel shell. Gel padding on the interior cushions the brain and other sensitive organs, making the bearer's head far better protected than with only natural tissues around it. Of course, cutting out huge swaths of bone creates a dramatic appearance. No two cranial reinforcements look the same, but in general the bearer can expect significant portions of his head to be rendered in gleaming or matte alloy instead of hair and skin, possibly covering or obscuring parts of the face as well. Members of the Adeptus Mechanicus who eagerly replace flesh and bone with metal and composites will often strive to create a strictly mechanical appearance that meshes seamlessly with their respirator units and other cranial implants, while those who wish to preserve their existing looks are well cautioned to consider this augmetic's effects on the shape and profile of their head. Cranial reinforcement adds 1 AP to the character's Head location which stacks with any armour worn. Additionally, if the bearer suffers Impact Critical Damage to the Head location, the reinforcement mitigates some lingering effects. If Stunned, reduce the duration by half; if the character gains levels of Fatigue, reduce the number of levels gained by half (both to a minimum of 1).
