Calmer (Drug)
These sedative capsules are thought of as being 
the purview of voidsick pilgrims and shell-
shocked Guardsmen, but anyone suffering from
the after-effects of severe trauma can benefit
from their soothing effect. Therapeutic in
nature, calmers can be especially helpful in
preventing a mental breakdown or psychotic
episode in those that have had horrifying
experiences, such as witnessing a hive blackout,
being trapped in a manufactorum fire, or
encountering a ravenous beast that's crawled up
from the underhive - even members of the
Inquisition have taken up the habit of
suppressing unpleasant encounters, though few
would admit it. Calmers are affordably priced
but are still beyond the reach of especially poor
and destitute citizens who must try and make
due with their personal hauntings, sometimes
with very unfortunate effects.
A dose of calmers takes about 20 minutes
before it becomes effective. Once ingested,
calmers impose a -20 penalty to the character's
Perception and a -5 penalty to their Initiative
(minimum 1) for 1d10+5 hours due to the drug's
highly allaying qualities. The character may
ignore the effects of any Minor mental disorders
during this time. Further, if the character is
suffering from any Mental Traumas, reduce the
result on Table 6-8: Mental Traumas by 30 for
the duration of the drug's effect.
