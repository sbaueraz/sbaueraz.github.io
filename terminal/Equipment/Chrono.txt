Chrono

Short for chronometer, these items are generally worn on the wrist or carried in a pocket and can keep the bearer up to date on thecurrent time,
though how accurate the readings are depends on the craftsmanship of the item as well as the consistency of the wearer in ensuring that the chrono is set correctly.
Most units use a mechanical set of hands on a dial, but more expensive units could make use of electricallypowered digits instead, and particularly extravagant examples might have a powered 
hololith that projects the time into the air above the wearer’s arm.
