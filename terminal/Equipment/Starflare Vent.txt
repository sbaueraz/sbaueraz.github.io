Starflare Vent:

Upgrades: Any Plasma weapon

This modification is both dangerous and a blatant act of tech-heresy, but the results are stunning enough that heretek tinkerers and outlaw tech-wrights with the right skill and luck seem to have no shortage of demand. By deliberately weakening and obfuscating a plasma weapon's magnetic containment field, the weapon ceases being able to generate coherent bolts of photonic hydrogen and instead vomits forth a great column of annihilation out to a short distance. On already temperamental weapons armed with fickle fusion cores and unstable ammunition, use of a starflare vent can very easily have disastrous consequences - and not just from the righteous retribution of incensed Tech-Priests and their Secutors cohorts. Of course, the power to utterly vaporise an entire mob of enemies with a single burst of solar intensity can make these concerns seem significantly less pressing. A plasma weapon modified with a starflare vent reduces its Range to one quarter (25%) its normal value, its Rate of Fire becomes S/-/- if it wasn't already, and its Clip size is halved due to the massively increased rate of hydrogen consumption. However, the weapon's massive attack now affects an area as though it had the Flame quality. If a plasma weapon modified with a starflare vent overheats, roll 1d10. On a result of "8" or higher, the vents have caused a catastrophic feedback loop and the plasma weapon violently explodes; treat this as though the weapon had rolled maximum Damage with a Blast of 5. The wielder cannot attempt an Agility Test to avoid the blast. This modification is essentially permanent; only the Tech-Priests of Ryza or another forge world blessed with the rare understanding of plasma weaponry could reverse the modifications, which most would be eager to do immediately after terminating the fool that would bring them such a blasphemously defiled weapon.
