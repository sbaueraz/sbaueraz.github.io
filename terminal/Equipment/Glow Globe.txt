Glow-globe/Lamp Pack:

Most men and women are naturally afraid of the dark, and for good reason - naturally blind in such conditions, a man or woman is easy prey for savage beasts that stalk in darkness, not to mention terrain an environmental pitfalls that exist in a plethora of forms through even the most advanced and developed of worlds. Lamp packs and glowglobes are a common remedy to this problem, allowing the bearer to bring light and (usually) safety with him into darkened areas. Lamp packs are usually self-contained cylindrical or conical housings made of metal or plastek with a clear area so that a gas-filled bulb, fluoro-tube, or chemical flame can shine outward in all directions. A glow-globe works off of the same principle but tends to be more spherical with a magnetic or adhesive base so that it can literally be stuck to an available surface. This sample example provides illumination in a 10 to 15 metre radius for about twelve hours before needing to be recharged or refuelled, though larger and heavier examples might project light out significantly further.
