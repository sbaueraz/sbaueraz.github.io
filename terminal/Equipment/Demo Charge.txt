Demo Charge:

A demolition charge – demo charge for short – is a simple but effective device meant to bring down unnecessary structures and clear rubble or debris out of the way of work being performed. The shape and composition of a demo charge varies widely, but in general it will be formed of a large quantity of cheap, low-grade explosives packed into a satchel or canister and fitted with a suitable triggering device. The charges are bulky and heavy for the amount of destructive power they bring, but are quite reliable at what they do. Demo charges are nominally civil devices, but they are often used in military situations for sabotage and creating defensive works. In theory, a demo charge can be used in combat, but this is a remarkably perilous endeavour. Imperial Guardsmen tasked with carrying a demo charge for breaching field obstacles are almost invariably volunteers and receive double pay along with better rations as an incentive for their incredibly dangerous payloads. A demo charge is inert until it has been primed and armed with a detonator - see Demolition on page 101 of Dark Heresy for more information on setting an explosive. A demo charge inflicts 3d10 points of Explosive Damage in a five metre blast - linking multiple demo charges together increases the Damage by 2 points and the blast by one metre for every additional charge. Attempting to combine five or more demo charges together increases the Difficulty of the Demolition Test by one step for each additional charge beyond the fourth. A Demolition Test can be made while the charge is being placed or in advance, leaving the charge armed and ready to explode as soon as the setter activates the detonator. However, carrying an armed demo charge is incredibly dangerous: if the character carrying the charge takes more than 5 points of Explosive Damage or 1 point of Energy Damage the charge immediately goes off. The character carrying the charge cannot attempt an Agility Test to avoid the blast.
