Mono Edge:

Upgrades: Any Primitive melee weapon with the Primitive quality

Normal knives and swords can cut through flesh and bone just fine, but typically have a much harder time puncturing armour made on any of the Imperium’s many forges. By reforging the blade with a monomolecular edge (Mono for short), these simple weapons stand a much better chance at digging through an opponent’s protective gear and mangling the soft flesh behind it. A mono-edged blade never loses its sharpness no matter how often it is used as each slice and chop causes the blade to hone itself rather than becoming duller. Mono-knives and swords are fairly common equipment for better equipped fighters throughout the Imperium. Only an edged weapon can benefit from having a monomolecular edge, however this upgrade can also be used to represent a similar modification or re-design of blunt weapons too; a hammer might have a pneumatic accelerator built into the head, while a staff could have a liquid metal core that enhances the force of struck blows. In all cases, the weapon loses the Primitive quality and increases its Penetration value by 2. Note that weapons which have received the Mono Edge upgrade cannot benefit from any other upgrades that require a weapon to have the Primitive quality.
