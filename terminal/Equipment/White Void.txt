White Void
 
White void is a notably popular drug that
sends the user into a peacefully hazy state where
they are comforted by nondescript feelings of
beatific well-being. The stuff is fairly simple to
make and appears to be derived entirely from
synthetic compounds that can be easily acquired
on just about any developed Imperial world.
Unlike many drugs, white void cannot be taken
on its own - the powdery product is typically
dissolved in water into which a pack of lho-sticks
are immersed. When the water dries out -
evaporation works best, but it can be boiled in a
pinch - the white void-laced lho sticks are
smoked normally. Long-term usage of white
void tends to cause discoloration of the eyes,
eventually leaving the user's oculars totally
colourless and appearing nothing more than
black pupils on a vast expanse of white. White
void is extremely addictive and can hook regular
users with the utmost of ease, but it has no major
long-term side effects that
oking regular lho-sticks.
Once smoked, white void takes 1d5+5 minutes
to become effective. A character smoking a lho-
stick laced with white void gains a +20 bonus on
any Willpower-based Tests for 1d10 minutes.
After the initial high expires, the character's
improved mood and feelings of confidence still
impart a +5 bonus on Tests made to resist Fear
and Pinning for another 1d5 hours. When the
drug completely wears off, the user finds himself
left with a surly and dour attitude, suffering a
-20 penalty to any Fellowship-based Tests for the
same amount of time that they were under white
void's effect. A character who takes three or
more doses of white void in a weeklong period
must pass a Hard (-20) Willpower Test or
become addicted, thereafter being unable to
function without taking at least one dose every day, "to start things off right".
