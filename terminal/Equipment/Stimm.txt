Stimm
 
Stimm is a generic term for a voluminous amount of fast-acting drugs that are meant to suppress pain and invigorate the user, allowing him to fight on (or flee faster...) in spite of terrible wounds or crushing exhaustion. Stimm is most commonly encountered in military
situations, but anyone who fights for a living would be well served to have a stimm or two on their person, and they are an integral part of any field medikit. A stimm's effect is short-lived, but being able to move when a victim would ordinarily be consigned to a slow death on the ground has no doubt spared innumerable souls an early reunion with the God-Emperor. Stimm takes effect immediately and lasts for 3d10 Rounds. During this time the user cannot be Stunned or knocked unconscious and ignores the negative effects of Fatigue. Should the character have suffered Critical Damage, a dose of stimm allows him to ignore any negative effects to his physical Characteristics, though broken and lost limbs or blinded eyes are still just as useless.
