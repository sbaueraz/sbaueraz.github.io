Photo-Visor

Photo-visors use complex electrically-powered filtration lenses to amplify ambient light, allowing the wearer to see in the dark almost as
well as in perfectly well-lit areas. As a result, they are almost always a popular and sought-after gear choice for all matters of men who must
operate at night or in darkness, and have been donned by assassins and bodyguards, enforcers and reclamators, commandos and infiltrators, and innumerable others.
Good Craftsmanship photo-visors can employ more sophisticated filtration systems to shield the wearer from exceptionally bright light,
rendering them immune to the blinding effects of photon flash grenades and similar devices.
