Pain Ward:

A pain ward, as the name suggests, prevents the bearer from feeling physical pain. The implant takes the form of a flat, paper-thin sheet of flexible circuitry that is inserted under the skull where it literally re-wires the areas of the bearer's brain. Excruciating pain is replaced with strange perceptions of colour, taste, or nothing at all as the synaptic relays are deliberately confused by the implant's circuits. While the immediate applications of such an augmetic may seem appealing to those who fight and die for a
living, it is more commonly employed by debased nobles and entertainers who don't want to let an accidental injury stymie a good time. Cost isn't the only reason, however - being
unable to feel pain can have conspicuously dangerous effects in and of itself, such as not being cognizant of contact with a hot surface until the bearer smells cooking flesh.
A pain ward renders a character immune to Stunning and other involuntary actions or penalties that result from painful events, such as Critical Damage, being set on fire, drowning,
and so forth. The character can still be Stunned from other types of forces, such as being subjected to a Takedown attack. At the GM's discretion, the character may have to begin making Awareness Tests to realise he's taken Damage, especially if it was from a more subtle source such as a silenced sniper's bullet or a poisoned stiletto.
