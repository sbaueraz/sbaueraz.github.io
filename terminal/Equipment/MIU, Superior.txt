MIU, Superior:

Some types of mind impulse unit are even more substantive than most styles and patterns. Aside from teh cortical or spinal socket, the bearer will also receive connector probes wired into their wrists (or fingers if they have bionic hands) to transfer both tactile as well as logical data from teh machine spirits. Superior mind impulse units are rarely encountered outside the realms of the Mechanicus, and those who do bear them tend to have a strong relationship with members of the Martian Priesthood or some similar pursuit of esoteric knowledge. A superior mind impulse unit functions as the common augmetic but also grants +10% bonus to Logic and Inquiry Tests made with the connected machine. If the character is linked in to a war machine they gain a +10% bonus to Weapon and Ballistic Skill Tests made to use the machines combat systems.
