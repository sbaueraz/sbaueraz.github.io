Ocular Catechizer

This arcane instrument is a favoured tool of archivists, scriveners, sages, and Administratum officials who often work with voluminous bodies of text and handwritten documents. The intricate-looking devices, resembling ornate brass eyewear festooned with lenses and multifocal loupes, grand the wearer a potent ability to magnify and recognize patterns of information in written or visual materials. No mere set of bifocals, an ocular catechizer's machine spirit can literally help the wearer "read between the lines" and process data much more efficiently than with his own eyes and mind alone. That being the case, ocular catechizers have a reputation for particularly temperamental and easily-vexed machine spirits - if the wearer does not entirely focus on his task, the catechizer will often reward him with a severe headache and sore eyes. A character wearing an ocular catechizer gains a +10 bonus to any Literacy, Logic, Lore, or Search Test when close examination of written text or visual data (such as picts or patternsheets) are involved. Only physical materials can be scanned through in this way - ocular catechizers are not designed to read text displayed on data-slates or pict-screens. An ocular catechizer may be wired to a data-slate, cogitator, or similar device in order to record its impressions for later study; this can also be used to grant the wearer a +20 bonus to Trade (Copyist) Tests made to transcribe bodies of text. No other Actions may be undertaken while a character is using an ocular catechizer in this way. Should the character fail one of the above Tests by four or more degrees the ocular catechizer inflicts 1 level of Fatigue on the wearer as it inadvertently sends a painful feedback loop into the wearer's head.
