Chem Gland:

No mere mechanical dispenser, a chem gland is an masterpiece of the Magos Biologis - a completely organic device that functions as an ancillary organ which can secrete drugs and chemicals into the bloodstream by muscular compression. Other than perhaps surgical scars, the bearer presents no outward signs of the implant's presence, and its complete lack of machinery means nothing unusual appears on most auspex scans. Even more amazing is the gland's ability to biologically synthesise common drugs by absorbing their core compounds from the bearer's biology. Once the bearer has become familiar with the necessary somatic stimuli to trigger the gland's functions, he need not worry about needles and injectors ever again. A chem gland can replicate the effects of any of the following drugs: calmer, de-tox, frenzon, halo, kick, panimmune, painimmune, spur, stimm, wideawake. The gland can build up as many as three doses of the same drug over time, typically taking about a day for each dose. Alternatively, the bearer can "gland" any one drug as a Half Action by succeeding on a Routine (+10) Toughness Test, though this destroys any accumulated doses in the gland. Failure inflicts one level of Fatigue on the character as he overworks his muscles while prodding the gland into action, while failure by four or more degrees causes minor poisoning that inflict 1d10 points of Toughness Damage. Regardless of which, the gland still produces and applies the drug's effects.
