Voidskin:

Exposure to hard void, even briefly, is almost assuredly a fatal experience, and those that do survive are often crippled from the lack of air or ridden with tumours from cosmic energies. Among veteran voidsmen, this death is quite possibly one of the most feared of the myriad ways in which a man can meet his end while plying the stern mistress of the galaxy. Voidskin, a combination of physical augmetics as well as bio-chem conditioning, can offer a man a brief respite to claw his way back into a life-sustaining environment before the void claims him. A microfine flakweave is integrated with the lower layers of the bearer's external tissues while chemical hardening is performed on the orifices and membranes that would burst or rupture (those who receive this treatment often find these areas to be annoyingly itchy for weeks after the initial surgeries). Furthermore, tiny chemplant bladders are spread throughout the body - these release fast-acting protective agents that can temporarily shield the body against being irradiated or cooked by the aether's malignant power. Although undeniably useful for what it does, this implant's niche abilities as well as the fact that being "voided" is usually accompanied by other, equally fatal happenstance (such as being lit fire by rupturing power conduits or impaled by flying shafts of reinforcement bars) makes it a particularly rare augmetic. A character who has received the voidskin implant can spend an additional 1d10+3 Rounds in the void or another hard vacuum environment before suffering its effects.
