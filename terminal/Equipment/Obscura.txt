Obscura
 
Though almost universally prescribed and the
subject of enforcer crackdowns, this drug is
nearly as widespread as it is potent. Obscura
induces a peaceful dream-like state in the user
that can last anywhere from a few hours to all
day depending on the purity of the substance,
but tends to leave the user feeling deeply
depressed or despondent once the drug wears
off. Whether this is a chemical reaction of the
drug itself or simply the user suffering from
being returned to reality is unknown. Obscura
comes in a variety of forms, all of which have
strongly addictive qualities. The crystallized
powder is typically smoked or inhaled into the
nostrils, but users wanting a more intense effect
will often use organic acids to distil the powder
into a condensed liquid and inject it directly into
the bloodstream. Though relatively inexpensive
to manufacture, the "street price" tends to have a
massive mark-up due to its illegality. The
producers, smugglers, and dealers who supply
the stuff can make a very comfortable living off
of their addicted clients, though the risk of an
enforcer - or worse, Arbitrator - kill team
cking down the door is a constant companion.
A dose of obscura sends the user into a
euphoric trance filled with pleasant visions; cut
obscura lasts for 1d5 hours, while the pure drug
lasts for an additional 5 hours. While under its
effects the character suffers a -20 penalty to any
Perception, Intelligence, or Willpower-based
Tests, but is also considered to have the Fearless
talent as they are unable to actually rationalise
danger or peril. Once the drug wears off the user
suffers a -10 penalty to his Willpower and
Toughness for the next 1d10 hours as he goes
through a general malaise unless another dose of
obscura is taken. Using de-tox will end the
primary effects of obscura but cannot nullify its
secondary consequences.
