Vitae Supplaceor:

Broadly similar to the systems and engines used in the life sustainers of great voidships plying the empyrean, a vitae supplaceor is something of a personal indemnitas against all sorts of injuries and conditions that frequently result in expiration. A variety of compact implants are inserted into the bearer's torso, all of which only function if a spinal sensor detects impending death due to trauma. Arterial micro-pumps can keep blood flowing in the event of cardiac failure, electrolytic scrubber fibres stimulate the lungs to keep the body oxygenated, and reserves of procoagulant agents can prevent exsanguination, all with absolutely no input from the bearer. Which is in and of itself a highly desirous quality, as many forms of crushing injuries often leave their victims unconscious as they expire. A vitae supplaceor can only sustain its bearer for a few hours before their wounds overwhelm the implants' lifesustaining faculties, but this is usually more than enough time - if the medicae haven't arrived by then, they probably aren't coming at all. A character bearing a vitae supplaceor gains the Autosanguine talent any time he sustains Critical Damage and retains its effects until he is no longer considered Wounded. Additionally, at the GM's discretion, the character may have a 50% chance to survive what would otherwise be a fatal injury due to Critical Damage. If the vitae supplaceor saves the character in this fashion, it is able to sustain them for up to four hours, after which they expire if they haven't received adequate medical treatment to reduce their Damage to non-lethal levels.
