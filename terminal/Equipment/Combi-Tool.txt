Combi-Tool

Combi-Tools are immeasurably serviceable pieces of equipment that improve their owner's ability to manipulate many different types of machines and other forms of tech. A combi-tool can be found in innumerable patterns and shapes, but the most common variety take the form of a sturdy metal box that scissors open to reveal a plethora of attached implements that can be folded out and put to work. Combi-tools will typically include a full set of bits and drivers, small-size sockets and adjustable wrench heads, pliers and tongs, several blades, probes, a current detector, magnetic attractor, accessor-tines for use with cogitator maintenance, and probably a few other attachments as well. Outside of the Mechanicus, where ornate combi-tools are given to initiate enginseers as a mark of merit and accomplishment, it is likely that most owners of a combi-tool aren't sure what at least one of its attachments is meant to be used for. Regardless of their type, however, a combi-tool will invariably have at least one reinforced and hardened strike-plate for the sole purpose of  thwacking sacred runes to awaken a machine's slumbering spirit. A character using a combi-tool gain a +10 bonus to Tech-Use and Trade (Technomat) Tests when working with Imperial tech and mechanisms, though they may also be compatible with machinery of unknown or xeno provenance as well. Note that a combi-tool can't be used in all situations, and generally requires the user to have both hands free to manipulate the combi-tool and the item it is being used on.
