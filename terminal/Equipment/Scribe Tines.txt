Scribe-Tines:

Unlike most implants, this augmetic is actually designed to improve another augmetic rather than flesh and bone. Scribe-tines are a form of extremely versatile and dextrous manipulator that is well-purposed for rifling through great stacks of paper, tapping away at a runeboard, or reaching the many keys and switches on a control lectern. On command, the bearer's existing augmetic hand roughly splits in half and extends in a disturbing looking fashion, functionally doubling the number of fingers available as well as moderately increasing their reach. The long and thin digits lack tensile and gripping strength, making them ill-suited for labour. This fragility, combined with the very disqqueting appearance, means that even stuffy scholars and lexmechanics who have made use of the augmetic will keep them retracted when they aren't actively using them. The character must have at least one bionic hand or arm to receive this implant. Scribe-tines can be deployed or retracted as 1 Action Point. While deployed, the implant grants a +10% bonus on all Skill Tests involved with investigating where most types of data mediums are involved. However, at the same time the character is unable to attempt any Strength-based or Weapon Skill Tests using his hands.
