Ghostfire Pollen Extract:

Ghostfire pollen, native to the feudal world Iocanthus, is used as the main ingredient of frenzon in the Calixis Sector. The drug is produced through a variety of distillation and moderating procedures - the pollen itself is a fairly small portion of the final product. However, exceptionally motivated - or irrational - warriors have been known to inject pure pollen extract directly, which sends them into a frothing berserker state that makes a user of "common" frenzon look mildly disgruntled in comparison. The use of ghostfire pollen is strictly forbidden in the Imperial Guard and most planetary militias as it is considered far too great of a risk to the user - which, considering the dangers of a battlefield, should be a suitable warning as to its capabilities. A character who uses ghostfire pollen extract immediately falls under its effects, gaining all the benefits and penalties of the Frenzy talent along with the Unnatural Strength (x2) and Unnatural Agility (x2) traits. However, the user also takes 1 point of Damage (which ignores Armour and Toughness) due to system shock as the pollen takes over and the user begins to sweat blood. Should the user kill all enemies before the drug's effect wears off he must then attack any nearby characters or creatures, possibly including his allies. In absence of any other potential character or creature to attack the frenzied character must then assault any nearby objects (trees, rocks, walls, and so forth) until the drug's effects wear off. A dose of ghostfire pollen lasts for 2d10+5 minutes. If the character spends more than 10 minutes under the effects of ghostfire pollen, he must pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test once it wears off or gain a level of Fatigue as massive overexertion takes its toll.
