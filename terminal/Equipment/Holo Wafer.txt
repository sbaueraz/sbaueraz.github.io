Holo Wafer:

Holo wafers are small disposable devices about the width of a coin and no larger than a man's palm. Each contains a tiny power cell that provides enough power to project a small hololithic image when a button is depressed. Holo wafers are largely novelty items that are sometimes used as bargaining chips, badge or crest displayers, and signal markers - anything that a common card or small sign could be used for, but with a pleasing projected appearance that floats a few centimetres in the air. In the underworld of Hive Sibellus holo wafers tend to have a far more sinister application as the "marques" of professional assassins and hitmen sending the immediate signal to common hivers and enforcer heavies alike that a death was no mere murder. The symbology can vary widely, but those who are well connected in the criminal underworld - and all too often, the halls of the elite in the spires - will typically use a winking skull or a crying mother to show that powerful forces have ordered the killing. Holo wafers that turn up next to a corpse on distant worlds are especially profound, showing that the long and vindictive arms of intrigue from the Sector's capital know no distance or time.
