Infrared Goggles

Commonly referred to as IR goggles, this piece of gear allows the wearer to look into the infrared spectrum and is most commonly used for identifying sources of heat.
In industrial applications they can be crucial for determining points of failure or friction in machinery and piping, but they are also imminently useful for
spotting hiding enemies at night, making them favoured items among crack military troops and high-rent mercenaries. A character wearing IR goggles can see in
darkness without penalty and gains a +20 bonus to vision-based Perception Tests in such situations, though very hot environments and
thermally shielded enemies may counteract this or give the wearer “false positive” readings.
