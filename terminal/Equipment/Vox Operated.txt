Vox Operated:

Upgrades: Any non-Primitive ranged weapon (including Grenades)

For some users, simply clicking a switch or pressing a stud just isn’t good enough. A specially coded vox receiver can be integrated into a weapon’s firing mechanism and other innards so that the user can operate it simply by speaking the appropriate command words. This includes firing, switching fire modes, and ejecting a spent clip (though it must be replaced manually as normal). Weapons with a fire selector upgrade can have it operated vocally as well, and some who make use of this esoteric upgrade take particular appreciation of stating out loud exactly what type of projectile they are about to blast a foe with. For security reasons each receiver is usually keyed to a specific voice pattern to prevent unintended operation at a potentially disastrous moment. A vox operated weapon can be adjusted and fired without direct physical manipulation but otherwise has no immediate statistical effect. The receiver can pick out the shooter’s voice from around 10 metres away, though this range may be extended or reduced based on ambient noise. Vox operated weapons may have some other situational utility; for example, if the wielder has been apprehended by his opponents who are presently rifling through his equipment.
