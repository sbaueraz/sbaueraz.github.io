Re-Breather

Re-breathers make use of a self-contained air supply piped in to a helmet or mask, allowing the wearer to exist in extremely toxic environments or even to function underwater; they are highly in demand items among reclamators and other scavenger types who frequently operate in conditions that would fell an unprotected man in short order. Compared to military gas masks or civil respirators, a rebreather offers almost perfect protection but is only as good as the remaining air in its canister. While worn, a re-breather makes the wearer completely immune to the effects of most gases or inhaled toxins and can safely swim or dive underwater without risk of drowning. Rebreathers make use of disposable air canisters that last for about an hour before they must be replaced, which takes 3 Action Points and may expose the wearer to anything unpleasant that the re-breather was previously protecting them against. Spare canisters cost 25 Thrones, weigh half a kilogram, and are Scarce.
