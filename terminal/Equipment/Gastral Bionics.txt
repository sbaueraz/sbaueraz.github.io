Gastral Bionics:

Aside from those suffering from tumours or who've been critically injured in combat or via a terrible accident, bionic replacement of the digestive tract is a rare procedure due to complicated surgeries and the limited applications that a mechanical replacement provides. Gastral bionics replace the stomach and much of the intestines with augmetic analogues that use artificial membrances combined with enzyme solultions to break down food and drink much like the bearer's original organs did. The digestive enzyme admixture that cycles through the whole system is a minor marvel in and of itself, being collected and purified before being sent back to the beggining of the bionic to commence the process again, though most who bear this augmetic probably give it no further thought than for the minor discomfort and flatulence they sometimes experience. Aside from replicating the important digestive functions, gastral bionics also make very effective toxin screens - normally poisonous substances are simply excreted with the rest of the waste instead of being absorbed into the bloodstream. This virtual immunity to poisoned food has made more than a few spire nobles and rich gang lords spring for this augmetic simply to ensure they won't keel over after a fine meal. Gastral bionics duplicate all the normal biological functions of the digestive tract as well as making the bearer completely immune to almost all ingested poisons and toxins. Best Craftsmanship versions, usually one-off examples made for professional explorers and trackers, allow the bearer to derive nourishment from almost any organic material, though it does nothing to make questionable food sources any more palatable (or remove prickly brambles from the windpipe).
