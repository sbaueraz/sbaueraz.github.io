Magnoculars:

Through the magic of paired sets of glass or crystal focusing lenses, a set of magnoculars can allow inquisitive eyes to substantially magnify distant objects, allowing for closer inspection or surveillance. Magnoculars typically require a notable amount of adjustment and fine-tuning in order to present a clear image, but once the user has become familiar with the item's propensities, they can be an extremely helpful piece of kit. In general, a set of magnoculars can make a specific point anywhere from four to ten times as large to the viewer's perception. Agents and inspectors typically make use of magnoculars to more closely examine a distant item or area that requires their attentions, while explorers and hunters utilise the piece to scan for possible paths ahead and hiding or stalking prey. They are also commonly used in military situations as well, though an observer must always take cognizance that magnoculars only present a very small area at once, potentially blinding their user to activity at their flanks. Most types of magnoculars simply make things appear larger, but rarer and more costly versions and patterns may boast other ancillary features. A character actively using magnoculars may be entitled to Awareness Tests to see things that others without enhanced vision cannot, and can pick out greater detail of far-off objects or areas. In addition, Good Craftsmanship magnoculars can also determine the distance of a sighted object (out to a maximum of 1 kilometre) and can textually identify a range of common objects and targets, informing the viewer when they are looking at men, vehicles, machinery, beasts, and so forth. These additional qualities may grant bonuses to certain Skill Tests in a given situation, though what benefits may be derived are left to the discretion of the GM.
