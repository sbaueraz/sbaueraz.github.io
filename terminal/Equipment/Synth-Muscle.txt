Synth-Muscle:

Grown in culture vats from samples of the bearer's own blood, synth-muscles are carefully implanted into the bearer's existing musculature and tendons. As one could assume, this increases the bearer's physical strength by the simple expedient of growing their overall muscle mass. Once the implants have been properly grafted and accepted by the bearer's body the new flesh functions essentially as though it was their own - this includes getting flabby if the bearer becomes overly idle or indolent. Most synth-muscle grafting will noticeably increase the bearer's bulk and leave them with a more chiselled (if scarred) appearance. For those with a surplus of gelt and a deficiency in reason, a more advanced and aggressive grafting can turn them into a brutal meat mountain that is well suited to crushing lesser men with their bare hands. This requires more intensive surgical procedures as well as gene-engineering to make sure the huge bulk takes, not to mention ensuring the bearer's bones and circulatory system can handle his new muscle-bound form. "Normal" synth-muscle grafting permanently increases the bearer's Strength Characteristic by 10, making him generally more powerful at lifting, jumping, and clobbering enemies in melee combat. Huge grafts do the same, but also grant the bearer the Unnatural Strength (x2) trait while reducing their Agility Characteristic by 10 on account of the extreme mass of the new flesh. Additionally, the character must also eat roughly twice as much food as before in order to keep up with his artificially higher metabolic rate.
