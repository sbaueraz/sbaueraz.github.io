Locator Matrix:

A locator matrix is an invaluable gift of the Omnissiah to professional explorers and others who frequently operate in distant, unknown lands. Two tiny stacks of micro-cogitators are implanted at the base of the skull and neck, leaving thin parallel strips of shiny metal visible on opposite sides of the spine. The matrix's advanced self-positioning routines inform the bearer via empathic signals of true magnetic north. If the bearer has a data-slate handy, he can also plug it into the matrix's data-port to receive other information such as relative and absolute velocity, altitude, time of day, air pressure, and so forth. This information can be immediately useful for purposes of navigation and overland travel, but only if the bearer also has access to maps or some other kind of reference to compare the matrix's input to. Knowing which way is north can be of little utility if one doesn't know what direction he should be travelling in, never mind what's over the next rise. When used in conjunction with a map a locator matrix grants a +20% to Navigation Tests made while traveling. Even without any other gear, the bearer of a locator matrix can always determine which direction north is.
