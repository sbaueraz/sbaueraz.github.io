Screamer:

A common and typically quite effective security device, "screamer" is a broad term used to describe a plethora of devices that are designed to make an audible alert when its perimeter is breached. A screamer is about the size of a can of grox hash and will sometimes include a magnetic strip or a sturdy stake to anchor it to available surfaces. The device uses a simple motion tracker, aural sensor, and thermal `scanner to locate and identify the presence of potential enemies. A small cogitator stack processes the information and triggers an earshattering alarm that can be heard up to a kilometre away. A screamer includes ten identtokens that can be handed out to allies - anyone wearing one in an open location causes the screamer to politely ignore their presence. A character wishing to set a screamer must make on a Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test. If successful, the screamer activates and begins acting as a warder over the nearby area, making Awareness Tests as though it had a Perception of 75. A screamer watches over an area with a 30 metre radius, adding 5 metres for every degree of success on the setter's Tech-Use Test. Should the Test fail, the screamer appears to set properly, but some malfunction of its machine spirit (or the character not pressing the right button) reduces its Perception to 10 - most experienced explorers make sure to test a screamer's function (often by throwing a large rock or stick or some such object) to ensure that it has activated properly. Disarming a screamer requires an Easy (+30) Tech-Use Test, with failure likely causing the screamer to issue its horrendous racket when the user attempts to move it from its perch. A screamer can be left set for up to 5 days before its internal power cell needs to be recharged (this can be done using the same techniques as a las weapon's charge pack).
