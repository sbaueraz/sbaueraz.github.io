Synth-Skin
 
As the name suggests, this can contains an aerosol spray of binding enzymes and proteins mixed with powerful procoagulant agents and a topical pain/inflammation relief compound. Shaken and then sprayed onto an injury, synth- skin leaves a thin foam that sticks to the victim's
wound, causing rapid coagulation and promoting the regeneration of new skin. Timely application of synth-skin can be a saviour to a victim at risk of death by exsanguination, and its very simple use - point the nozzle at the wound and depress - means that average citizens or soldiers can provide potentially lifesaving intervention when a trained medic or skilled medicae is not available. While not its primary purpose, synth-skin is also an effective field treatment for burn injuries and preventing secondary infection. Some wounds also tend to heal better when quickly treated with synth-skin, producing smaller and more orderly scars. Using a can of synth-skin is 3 Action Points that automatically ends Blood Loss - no Tests are necessary. Synth-skin can be used as part of a Medicae Test to administer First Aid. If used on a character that has suffered Energy Damage resulting in burns, the medic gains a +5 bonus to his Test. One can of synth-skin is sufficient for five applications before it runs out.
