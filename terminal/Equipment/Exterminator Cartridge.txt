Exterminator Cartridge:

Upgrades: Any weapon

An even smaller Exterminator, the Cartridge version could easily fit in a pocket and can be attached to just about any other weapon. Although its flame is somewhat less impressive, few would expect a cumbersome heavy stubber or missile launcher to suddenly spew forth a column of fire at them. An Exterminator Cartridge uses the same rules as the normal Exterminator except it counts as a standard hand flamer. It can be fired in melee combat even if attached to a Basic or Heavy weapon.
