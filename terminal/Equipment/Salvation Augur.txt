Salvation Auger:

Salvation augers are pocket-sized devices that "sniff" the owner's immediate whereabouts in order to provide warning of hazardous environmental conditions. Designed to be both portable and easy to use, a salvation auger is typically flipped on when the wearer enters an area of suspect status, after which it is usually worn around the neck or on a belt. When the salvation auger's scan-nodes detect harmful radiation, airborne toxins, or other atmospheric hazards, the auger warns the user with a variety of cues and indications. Salvation augers are most commonly employed by hivers - decrepit and dilapidated expanses of Imperial hive cities can generate a plethora of noxious and lethal conditions, such as accumulations of radioactive vapour and virulently poisonous plant and fungal growths. An expedition down to the underhive, or reclamator endeavours into disaster-felled districts, may take all necessary precautions to avoid physical pitfalls and survive encounters with creatures or violent denizens, but neglecting to protect oneself against environmental hazards can be just as fatal. Though less common, salvation augers are also carried by explorers uncovering ancient ruins and architecture on distant worlds, as well as naval armsmen delving down into the abandoned decks of great voidships. A salvation auger produces a visual or audio warning when the wearer enters into an area that is contaminated with dangerous levels of radiation, toxic or poisonous gases or particles and other forms of environmental hazards. Good Craftsmanship salvation augers can provide more information than just the presence of danger - the user can attempt an Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use Test to manipulate the device into reporting the exact type and concentration of the hazard.
