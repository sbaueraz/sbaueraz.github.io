Auger Implants:

Compact yet sophisticated sensorum suites can be physically integrated with the nervous system and brain, granting the bearer enhanced perceptive abilities beyond the fundamental senses. Fibre-thin wires are carefully inserted into different areas of the brain and connected to a tiny logis stack implanted in the base of the skull to process the additional flow of sensory data. Externally, the bearer might sport a few small metallic studs or ports on their head, but on the whole the implant is unobtrusive unless the bearer desires a more dramatic effect (techpriests are particularly wont to do this, sometimes bearing additional cybernetic eyes or glowing vox detectors). The bearer can activate their augers simply through mental concentration, augmenting or subsuming their normal senses briefly to consult what others could never perceive without the aid of an auspex. Of course, like many other types of scanner, an auger implant isn't infallible and can be prone to interference and "false positive" findings - those who bear these augmetics should reserve their best judgement when their implant and biological senses sharply contradict. An auger implant duplicates the effects of an auspex in any Round in which the character spends a 1 Action Point to focus on its findings (the Tech-Use Test to use the auger in manual mode can be made as part of the action). Poor Craftsmanship implants function the same but only out to a 20 metre radius due to their smaller and less powerful sensors, while Good Craftsmanship implants allow the character to re-roll failed Perception-based Tests made while using the implant.
