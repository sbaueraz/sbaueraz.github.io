Cold Fire:
 
Sometimes known as "noble's
frenzon", this more costly drug is laced with
antipsychotics and tranquilizers that help
balance out some of the less desirable effects of
frenzon. The much shorter duration makes it
suitable for duellists and participants of combat
sports, but any user who happens to be in a fight
could benefit from the better control that cold
fire offers. This drug duplicates the primary effects of
frenzon, but the effect lasts 3d10 Rounds, and
the character also gains the benefits of the Battle
Rage Talent as well.
