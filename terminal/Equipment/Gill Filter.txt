Gill Filter

This strange rubbery mask adheres to the bottom half of the wearer's face, covering their nose and mouth with a wet, clammy layer of biomass. Despite its appearance being more akin to
a vaguely shaped wad of goo, a gill filter is actually an extremely sophisticated piece of gear developed by a cadre of Magos Biologis conducting research on the water world of Spectoris. 
The strange membranes act like the gills of marine creatures, filtering oxygen out of water which the wearer then respires normally. The exact means by which these miraculous items are manufactured remains a mystery;
there are no shortage of rumours, however, with some nefarious suggestions involving hideous deep sea creatures and cloned human flesh making the rounds through public houses and dives frequented by workers and explorers who use
the filters for prolonged submarine endeavours. A gill filter will sustain a submerged wearer's need for air indefinitely. However, the filters must be kept constantly immersed in water - if
exposed to air for more than about a minute the filter will dry out and wither, becoming a useless piece of brittle detritus. Gill filters are typically stored in a watertight metallic container when not in use.
