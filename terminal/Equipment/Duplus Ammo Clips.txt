Duplus Ammo Clips:

Upgrades: Any Pistol or Basic Las, Solid Projectile, or Bolt weapon with a removable clip

These double-ended clips store twice as much ammunition (or two charge packs) as the standard models, and when one runs dry, the user simply flips it over and inserts the other end. This significantly shortens reload time, and experienced users can load a fresh clip with almost no “dead time” at all. A duplus ammo clip reduces a weapon’s Reload time by half when used to switch between its stored ammunition. For example, a weapon that normally takes 6 Action Points to reload becomes 3 Action Points. If the user also has the Rapid Reload talent, it further decreases to 1 Action Point. Duplus ammo clips can’t be used in a weapon with a fire selector due to their size.
