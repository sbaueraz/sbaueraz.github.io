Vehicle Interface Circuitry:

Vehicle interface circuitry is a marvellous piece of techno-artifice that is believed to be one of the few relics from the Dark Age of Technology that is still understood and practiced in the present age. Glimmering, paper-thin circuits are implanted just below the skin of the bearer's palms and fingers. The tiny web-like augmetics mesh with the controls and yokes of machines specifically devised to work in concert with them, giving the bearer a sort of intuitive understanding of the machine's operations and needs. This tech is almost invariably found only in the cockpits of flyers and small voidcraft - tanks and walkers tend to have much simpler controls that require a far lower level of interaction, while great machines like voidships and Titans will usually mandate the use of a mind impulse unit or similar device that allows a direct man-machine connection. Because of this association, a man bearing vehicle interface circuitry on his hands - something few would willingly cover with gloves or otherwise obfuscate - can be almost certainly fingered as a skilled pilot or void-master. This implant grants a +10 bonus to Pilot Tests made with a vehicle that has the appropriate interface receptors. Additionally, a character so equipped can attempt a Perception Test (the Difficulty should be set by the GM depending on the situation) to determine the status and condition of the vehicle as a Free Action. This could provide information such as the remaining fuel or ammunition level, locating damaged areas, or simply gauging the readiness of the vehicle's machine spirit.
