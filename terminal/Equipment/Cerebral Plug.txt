Cerebral Plug:

A much simpler type of connector compared to a full mind impulse unit, cerebral plugs are fairly common augmetics among those who work with techno-devices frequently. A significantly reduced wire network runs through the bearer's brain to a small box at the top of the spine from which a plug attached to a ribbon wire can be retrived. By reeling out their plug, the bearer can connected himself to a variety of smaller and less complex machines, such as an auspex or vox-caster, and manipulate them without the use of manual controls. Devices that incorporate a display can also pipe their findings into the bearer's mind, allowing him to visualize the machine's read-outs rather than paging through a screen or rolls of data from an attached auto-quill. The cerebral plug is specifically devised to be unable to link with powerful machines - such a basic connector would likely cuase the bearer great injury or even death as the awesome power of great machine spirits overload their mind.
