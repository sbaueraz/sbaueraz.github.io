Det-Tape:

A seemingly harmless putty-like substance, det-tape is actually a highly explosive compound that is triggered when any kind of current is run through it. Det-tape is stable and easily shaped to fit on a variety of objects and areas, making it a very versatile explosive, but the low size and mass of the stuff tends to result in relatively small blasts. Det-tape is commonly used to set off larger charges simultaneously, but can also be employed to precisely sever large pipes and conduits. It is not typically considered a proper explosive on its own, but the Adeptus Arbites have become particular enthusiasts for using it as a convenient and effective way to breach solid doors - the tape is simply pressed around the perimeter of the door with the resultant blast sending it cleanly out of the frame. Det-tape must be carefully planted and affixedto ensure it remains in contact with the target - Demolition Tests to "arm" it take roughly twice as long as normal. Once planted, det-tape inflicts 2d5 points of Explosive Damage with a Penetration of 1 to anything it is in direct contact with. Det-tape is very stable and flexible, and will not explode even if set on fire, but just a single point of Damage from any source that also has the Shocking quality will immediately cause it to detonate, and areas with high static buildups may cause a spontaneous reaction as well.
