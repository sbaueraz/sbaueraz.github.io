Disguise Kit:

Altering one's appearance is one of the easiest and most straightforward means of subterfuge available as humans and even many xenos identify looks quite a bit more readily than any other physical quality. Disguise kits contain a variety of tools and aids meant to allow a character to artfully change his visage and perhaps other features as well. The name is something of a misnomer, however, as no manufactorums or commercia houses simply produce these items as prepared kits - most are hand-assembled by professional infiltrators where they take bits and pieces from a broad range of sources and combine them together into a single arsenal of deception. The level of
thoroughness, utility, and versatility of a given kit can be represented using the same scale as Item Craftsmanship. A disguise kit can generally be used up to 1d5+10 times. If a character succeeds on a Disguise Test by two or more degrees he uses only half as many supplies and materials as usual, in which case a single disguise kit could be potentially used as many as thirty times.
