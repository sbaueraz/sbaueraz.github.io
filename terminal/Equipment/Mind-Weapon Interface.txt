Mind-Weapon Interface:

This less costly derivative of the mind impulse unit is designed expressly to communicate with the machine spirits of handheld weapons. A single cable
connects the interface's external component, which resembles a smaller mind impulse unit's socket assembly, to a jack that is installed on the desired weapon. The bearer is then able to fire the weapon simply by focusing his mind on the action, and can also be kept abreast of other information the weapon's machine spirit may be in possession of. This could include the amount of remaining ammunition, barrel temperature, or if the weapon is in need of maintenance. In theory any kind of Imperial ballistic weapon could be made to work with a mind-weapon interface, but the most useful application of the device is in the attachment of pistol-type weapons in a servo-assisted shoulder mount, keeping the bearer's hands free to wield other implements, climb ladders, or theatrically denounce his foes with an incriminating finger. A mind-weapon interface can connect to most types of ranged weapons and grants the character the ability to fire the weapon without working the trigger and controls. He must still have hands free to reload or clear jams. For an extra 300 Thrones, the character can combine this augmetic with a servo-rig to attach a Pistol class weapon to one shoulder. This weapon is always considered Readied and can be fired even if the character has his hands full, is Grappling, or restrained. Note that this does not allow a character to make more than one Attack action per Round.
