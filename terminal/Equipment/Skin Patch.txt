Skin Patch:
 
Unlike most injectors, skin patches appear to be completely innocuous items whose true purpose may be lost on the average Imperial citizen. A skin patch takes the form of a square of thin transparent film about 10 centimetres on a side, and are most often stored in a disposable wrapper. Once removed, a skin patch is applied to an area of bare skin where it sticks in place - the drug is actually contained within the patch itself and leaches into the user's bloodstream by infiltrating through their skin. Very basic skin patches begin administering the drug immediately, but most are bio-attuned to retain their dose until activated by the user. This is typically done by applying a firm pressure to the entire patch - if applied properly, skin patches can be worn under most types of armour, with the user simply compressing the area in a prescribed fashion to activate the patch. Skin patches are especially useful for those wearing heavy armour or void suits - an autojector is typically out of the question - but can also be appreciated by men with a particular distaste for needles. A character may apply a skin patch as a Full Action - once applied, a skin patch retains the drug for 1d5-2 days (minimum1), after which it dries out and begins to peel off. As a Half Action, the user can activate the skin patch at any time during this period.
