Bionic Weapon Attachment:

Although only commonly employed by militant tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus, a bionic arm can be configured to conceal smaller types of weapons within its frame. Rearrangement of the bionic's internal structures can make room for the operating parts of most types of pistols and bladed melee weapons to be partly or fully hidden within. Pistol-type weapons tend to be constructed in-line with the arm's longitudinal axis, the muzzle lying flush with the palm to release its projectiles from the bearer's outstretched hand. Blades can be mounted in a number of ways, including sliding, swinging, or scissoring actions, though in general the weapon extends along the arm's line and is swung accordingly. A bionic weapon attachment can be quite a boon in situations where weapons can't be bared openly, though it may be of little use in circumstances where the bionic itself sticks out badly. A bionic weapon attachment can mount any pistol or small melee weapon, such as a chain knife or power blade, completely concealing it from view until the weapon is used. While the weapon is hidden only an auspex scan can reveal it, though those familiar with such augmetics may be able to recognize the signs of such a mounting if the bearer's bionic arm is not covered by clothing. A weapon that is integrated as a bionic weapon attachment can't be Disarmed, but if the weapon Jams or Overheats it also partially disables the arm until the character clears it (or it cools down). The bionic attachment also allows the character to keep a hand free that would ordinarily wield the weapon, though shooting may have unfortunate consequences for whatever the hand is holding.
