Electro-Flail:

Electro-flails are groups of tendril-like lashes, attached to a short staff or handle and swung in sharp, quick snaps. These flails have a short incapacitating a foe. Electro-flails are common sights at manufactorums that use forced labour as they make an intimidating, whip-like crack as they strike an obstinate worker, and there are many types of servitors with electro-flails implanted in their limbs specifically to assist forge overseers in quelling any potential unrest.
