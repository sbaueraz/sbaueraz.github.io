Stormchild Hand Cannon:

The Stormchild is a venerable and proven design taking the form ofa massive hinged-frame stub revolver. While totally lacking in subtlety with a wide barrel, thick frame, and massive report, the Stormchild offers a lot of firepower in a very affordable package. For less than the price of most autopistols, a shooter can put a big enough slug in the air that can knock a man out of light armour or damage grav-cars and other civilian vehicles. Stormchilds are manufactured by most forges in the Calixis Sector and are commonly used by naval boarding parties, Administratum inspectors, and as a self-defence weapon by more paranoid civilians. Its size and weight allow it to be used as a club in melee combat, and most feature a wide pommel for just this purpose.
