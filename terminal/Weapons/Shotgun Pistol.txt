Shotgun Pistol:

A Shotgun Pistol is a compact weapon holding a single shotgun shell and using a tip-up barrel to facilitate reloading. Simple and reliable, shotgun pistols have a variety of applications in close-range destruction, but are perhaps best known in naval circles where they are often carried by petty officers and bosuns to discourage mutiny among press-ganged crews. Shotgun pistols are known as “Persuaders” among ratings and anyone else with a nautical background, and may be referred to by any number of more colourful titles (“Foehammer”, “Castigator”, “Justicar”, and so forth) by terrestrial users. A shotgun pistol's fierce recoil imposes a -10 penalty on Ballistic Skill Tests made to attack unless the shooter holds the weapon with two hands or has a Strength Bonus of 4 or more.
