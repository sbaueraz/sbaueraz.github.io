Blind Grenade:

Used With: Thrown, GL, RPG
Blind grenades explode with a burst of dense dark grey smoke that obscures normal vision while scattering thousands of particulate IR
bafflers and EM spectrum chaff to befuddle advanced visual sensors. The effect is short-lived, but while it lasts it provides an excellent cover for advancing forces or to facilitate a quick withdrawal. A blind grenade’s vapour discharge dissipates after 1d10+1 Rounds though weather conditions may significantly reduce this time. Characters within the blast area while the smoke remains are considered to be Blind.
