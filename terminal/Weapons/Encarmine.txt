Sulymann Encarmine Service  Pistol

This is a fairly advanced autopistol that crams a large number of bullets into its small frame. This combination of small size and high capacity makes it a commmon sidearm by "second liners" such as plainclothes enforcers, hauler rig crews, and construction foremen. It also enjoys widespread popularity as a self-defence weapon for hab-workers who don't trust shaky, panicked hands to reloading a fresh clip (or taking steady aim for that matter).
