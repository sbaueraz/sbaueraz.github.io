Voss Assault Launcher:

 This grenade launcher resembles more common patterns but with the addition of a clockwork cylinder mechanism that must be wound up during reloading. The cylinder remains under tension and can fire off its grenades with a frightening pace, making it an excellent choice for shock troops who need to suppress a large enemy force at once. The violent motion of the cylinder’s rotation tends to make the assault launcher want to jump out of the shooter’s hands; they are known for their volume of firepower, not pinpoint accuracy.
