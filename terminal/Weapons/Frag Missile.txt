Frag Missile:

Used with: Missile Launcher 
A large-size fragmentation device meant to obliterate exposed enemies. Frag missiles incorporate what looks lik an inflated frag grenade attached to a rocket motor or propellant charge depending on which launcher will be firing it. The greatly increased explosive charge as well as the shrapnel quantity makes a blast from a frag round far more deadly, even for well-armoured targets.
