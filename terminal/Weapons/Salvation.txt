Sulymann “Salvation” Holdout Pistol:

The Salvation is an extremely compact pistol no larger than a thick deck of cards and intended for use by merchants, adepts, and common citizens who are untrained in weapons. It is entirely self-contained and easy to use with no extraneous levers or knobs, but is also ill-suited for anything but emergency self-defence use since it must be partially dismantled to reload its internal ammunition supply. The Salvation’s small size grants a +10 bonus to Sleight of Hand Tests made to conceal it, and the firer suffers no penalties for shooting it without the appropriate Talent.
