"Flametongue" Howdah Pistol:

The Fykos Forge of Gunmetal City is a prestigious clan of master gunsmiths who specialise in elaborate and finely made hunting weapons, and the Flametongue pistol is no different. This simple and reliable weapon resembles a master-crafted hack shotgun that is chambered to fire huge, custom-made soft alloy rounds that break apart on impact to cause horrific wounds. Intended as a last line of defence should a hunter be ambushed by a dangerous thin-skinned predator, there is an expression among professional game hunters that anything that can't be put down with both shots from a Flametongue is probably something that shouldn't be hunted in the first place.
