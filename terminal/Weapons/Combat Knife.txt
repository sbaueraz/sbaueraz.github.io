Combat Knife:

Combat knives can only liberally be called knives to begin with, often featuring a straight blade the size of a human forearm with a clipped point that is both intimidating in profile and can make for nasty piercing and slashing attacks, and are commonly used as bayonets by the Imperial Guard. They also make fine can openers.
