Anybody reading this, there is something you need to know about the Peregrinus family. There is a dark secret in that family that they wish to hide from the Imperium. I’ve prepared the evidence in a file embedded on this cogitator. They’re coming for me and all of my company files will be deleted soon. You must save this data and bring it to a friend of mine in the Magistratum named Olan O'Hennessy. 


There is no time to explain the depths of their depravity, all the information is encoded here. Officer O'Hennessy will know what to do. Make this last ditch action of my miserable life worth something.
