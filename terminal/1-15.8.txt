Log#004:

They cut our rations AGAIN, all the while most of us can barely stand. The Lord Militant asks for faith, I have faith, more than anyone. But there are those in our ranks who do not and I've heard talks of a riot. I don't want to have to kill my friends, even if they are heretics. What do I do oh lord? Give us guidance, why haven't we been saved? 

In the past many months we have been tested plenty, but I wont be the one who falls, Captain Titus has put a reward of nutrient tablets for anyone who turns in a heretic and I know several, the God Emperor won't let us be saved until all the heretics are put down. Maybe a riot isn't so bad afterall? To purge us of the wicked so we may reach salvation. I just pray that those I care about are on the right side.
