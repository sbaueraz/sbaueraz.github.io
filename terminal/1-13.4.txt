SUBJECT: Update on the Hunt

An update on the case as it pertains to the idol. We have identified new individuals who may be tied to the Panaard family and their accomplises. Four of them recently made an attempt at retrieving information about various shipment logs for the Misericord. We believe this is being done with the intent to track down the idol. 

What relationship these individuals have with the Panaards is unknown at this time as anyone with a direct relationship with them would in theory not need the information the data log contains. We believe somebody else is getting involved with the hunt, it could even be another force of Inquisitorial Acolytes, one of them appears to have been a psyker since a strong psionic manifistation was felt throughout the facility. 

As for the idol itself we still have reason to believe that it is in the hands of the Slag Slingers, why they were brought into this and what their relationship is with Panaard is unknown but we are working on tracking down their leader now to form a deal. So far these attempts have been unsuccessful but with a few more resources we could perhaps persuade them.
