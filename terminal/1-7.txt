CHAT LOG: Johnsinus Alch

Johnsinus: "I've read through the plan and it hasn't gotten any less rediculous, there's no way you can go through with this!"

Kiri: "You don't get it, this is PREME information, almost nobody knows this transfer is happening, they won't be expecting it!"

Johnsinus: "I'm not doubting that your info is good, or even that it's maybe the best way to do this, I'm just saying that YOU Kiri are an airtraffic control officer, not some agent of the Golden Throne or Inquisitor, your going to get yourself killed out there."

Kiri: There's nobody else, and Hatchito would have done the same for me if I was caught up in the ogrynn piss situation that he is. It's happening.

Johnsinus: If you insist on doing this then... Drusus watch over you, I'll say a prayer for you at mass."
