Cogitator, save this as a personal data entry. I was talking with a friend of mine within the Administratum and they said that the Skaelen-Har nobility were thinking of lowering the value of Scints in the Spire. She said that she started converting most of her scabs into Thrones Gelts just incase. Not very useful but could pay off I guess. She keeps hers hidden under her mattress, not a bad idea...
