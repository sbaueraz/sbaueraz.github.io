Log#002:

Nobody here respects my command! Am I not second in command here? Do I not speak for the Lord Militant? My word is law here. I will restrict rations even further until they learn respect. If they will not obey then they will not eat. Simple as that. 

At first I thought it a strange thing, the voice of the God Emperor in my dreams, but now I hear it even as I wake. More and more clear it becomes that all of this, the hivequake, the Lord Militants coma, all is part of his holy plan for me to lead these people to salvation. They will not understand, but I know how to make the weak come forth and show their true selves. They think they can hide from me, but as I press my boot down upon their necks the true heretics will claw and fight as they know their end is near, while the holy and worthy will sit in prayer knowing that the God Emperor would never allow the final stroke to come. 

This is the way.
