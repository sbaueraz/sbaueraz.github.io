>Biologis Majoris Data Review:

We have reviewed the new samples from Zeisholzer Biogenetics. Studies confirm that the effects of drinking copious amounts of Cherry 40k results in 75% of the flavour compounds leeching into the muscle and fatty tissues for a duration of at least 3 terrain weeks. Prolonged exposure is sure to increase flavour viability over longer periods of time. Corpse starch harvested from individuals with at least 6 months of exposure showed flavour profiles of at least 90% in all tests conducted on hive citizen from throughout the Slagerfeld with 90% of taste testers agreeing that they picked up on strong cherry flavorings in the biscuit. 

Prolonged exposure of at least 4 months consumption results in a breakdown of the muscle material after absorbing the flavour compounds resulting in the subjects death nearly two months before optimal flavour is reached. Magos Biologists recommend that for improved results we tweak the chemicals to either be more potent in how it is absorbed into the muscles to lower incubation time to sooner than 4 months, or decrease lethality of Cherry 40k so that subjects lifespan lingers for the full 6 months for optimal flavour to be reached.

We will begin testing in both of these manners until a clear solution as to which path is better is determined.
