Incident Report:Skt Agnus International Space Port, Data Repository Breach

Quarter to Shift B confidential source within the Magistratum reports four individuals, two females and two males, entering the facility without clearance. Once discovered they were forced to exit the facility. 

Confidential informant contacted us about the potential breach and we sent in three teams to clear the building and purge cogitator data banks of all information pertaining to Misericorde Shipment Log-2189300006274305.

There were to be no survivors. Team C met heavy resistance and all were killed in the resulting fire fight. Team B on the floor directly beneath the data bank was then assaulted by intense psionic attacks, reports from the one surviving mercenary states that daemons held aloft on foul feathered wings errupted from the immaterium and proceeded to tear apart the majority of Team B. 

Team A had no issues and were holding their position on ground level incase subjects exited on foot through the mag lifts. Nobody was sighted exiting the facility. Magistratum were then allowed to enter and conduct a clean sweep of the facility. Reports indicate none of the four were killed. Putting out bounty for information on the whereabouts of these individuals to all Brotherhood of Thallos members and also forwarding information to Sons of Dispater with same bounty.

Subjects are believed to have accessed shipment log and are in persuit of the idol same as us. Further information is not yet known at this time.
