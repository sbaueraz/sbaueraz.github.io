Sergeant Beloran Van-Draxon:
 
Officer Scabstone,
  
I will be having Finegan Elmsly switching posts with you on your next shift. Ward B-16 has had three attempted riots and we had to put down 3/4's of them. The Lord Militant has reportedly sent word for another 35,000 conscripts from our penal ranks and you have a good track record with keeping the peace. I'm hoping that you will have a positive influence there and want your experience to be leading the enforcers in that wing. If things go well you will have your promotion waiting for you at my desk.
  
If you have questions that come up they will have to wait for the next standard week as I will be recovering from an upcoming surgery at the Sokhmann &  Martin Medical Facility. Otherwise we will review progress when I return. Emperor protect enforcer.
