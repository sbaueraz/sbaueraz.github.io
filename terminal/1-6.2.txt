Greyhound,

I have your payment of 20,000 Scabs set aside at your favorite place, Daughters of the Emperor. I know it always takes you a long time to get back into town so I gave it to them to keep safe until you're ready to claim it. Talk to Lady Kasuri and tell her, "Ryoken ga ryori o tori ni kuru." She'll give you what you're owed. Don't get greedy though, she's got ties with the Slag Slingers and I told her not to take any shit.

Sincerely,

Sachsman Goldtooth
