Header: Need Results!
  
      Both myself and the one who hired us are getting sick and tired of hearing your excuses Guilderland, we have given you all the resources you could need to track down what was asked of you and yet you've blown it all on lavish estates and fancy trinkets with us being no closer to being in possession of the idol!

      This is becoming unacceptable. Time and time again you have touted how close you are to finding it and now after 10 years with several confirmed sightings we learn that you continue to fail us. I swear to He Who Sits on Terra it will not be my head on the chopping block for this failure if it escapes us again, it will be yours.
