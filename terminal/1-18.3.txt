Fuck this, the little girl... the blood... Something here is driving people insane, I'm seeing things that were there one moment and gone the next. A man named Malik tried to calm me but then I saw his true face... I ran. Ran outside being chased by that old grunt of a soldier. He was cursing after me as we sprinted through the halls. I refuse to stay another night. Carmen is begging me to stay, to convince others to come help. No story is worth this, the Emperor himself has forsaken this place. I'm going to my room to grab my things and then I'm out.
