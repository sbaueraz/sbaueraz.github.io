Mr. Von Rock,
     We have noticed that you have been behind once again on your protection taxes. That is most unfortunate as without it people have been known to suffer a wide variety of issues that we would hate to befall you. I would hate to have to remind you again. If I don’t see improvements on finances soon, I will probably be forced to send one of my mercenaries to pay you a visit. Neither of us want that, so get me results Roro. Or you’ll be scavenging for parts in the Underhive next, and trust me when I say that I look like one of the Emperors angels compared to the gangs you’ll run into down there.
