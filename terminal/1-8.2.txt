Nani and I could not be prouder of our child, they will be holding a omnitool in no time! They are almost old enough for the Chief Enginist to perform the service of Bessimer Jone. Then our child will finally be a fully fledged Enginist. A proud moment for any member of our caste as we lost many good friends to the tempermental anger of our divine Left Rotational Thruster XIII. 
I saw some Ratters in our area the other day, talking about strange behavior amongst the pests aboard, they believed it was caused by some artifact aboard the ship. It is strange, for just the night before I had dreams, I would almost call them visions, of a crate somewhere in the ships cargo. Calling to me. I will talk with Nani about it, maybe there's something to it?
