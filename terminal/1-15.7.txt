Log#003:

Power is back online after over a week of wandering around in the dark. Finally some good news. Morale is still dwindling though since they decided to cut back our rations. Makes one wonder if things are going to get worse before they get better. Hope people like the taste of biscuits because sounds like it's going to be a few more weeks at this pace. Must have been a really bad hivequake. 

In other news the power is only helping with the smell in some parts of the facility, I feel bad for anyone posted up on the upper floors, the amount of bodies piled up there is giving off a rancid smell. A grim reminder that not all of us who got in made it in time to avoid the toxic fallout. Captain Titus says that the Lord Militant is looking into getting rid of them though. All will get better in time.
