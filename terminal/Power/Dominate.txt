Effect: The psyker nominates a number targets in range and line of sight up to half his psy rating (rounded up) who oppose this power with a Willpower test. Each target that fails to resist the
power must follow a simple command given by the psyker. Some example orders include “Flee,” “Fall,” or “Attack your friend.” If the command is a potentially suicidal act, each target receives a +20 to its Willpower test to Oppose the power. In all cases, the command must be achievable in a single round.
