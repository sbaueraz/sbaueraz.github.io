SUNBURST:

The psyker releases a nova of fiery energy from his body. As the psyker focuses his power, a blazing aura coalesces around him, growing brighter and hotter before rapidly expanding outward in all directions. As the calm at the eye of the firestorm, the psyker is untouched, while all around him is reduced to ash and cinder.
