PSYCHIC SHRIEK:

Drawing a deep soul-breath, the psyker unleashes a rippling Warp tide that sears the souls and blasts the minds of those in its path. The violent psychic wave is enough to overwhelm and shut down the minds of those it strikes, while those not slain outright are left reeling and dazed.
