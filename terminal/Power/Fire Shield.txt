FIRE SHIELD:

With but a gesture, the psyker summons a wall of shimmering, unnatural fire in the air before him. Any who would strike the pyromancer must contend with fiery retribution, as flames leap outward, travelling in reverse down the path of the bullet or lasbolt to strike the psyker’s assailant.
