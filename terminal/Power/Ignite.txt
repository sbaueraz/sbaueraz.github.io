Effect: The psyker creates a small flame, approximately a centimetre across, at a point within range and line of sight. The flame is not large or hot enough to inflict damage, but can illuminate roughly a 5 metre radius. It can also ignite combustible materials at the GMâ€™s discretion, with the chance of igniting an object increasing the longer the psyker sustains the power. If the target of this power is a character, he must pass a Challenging (+0) Agility test each round the psyker sustains the power after the first, or catch fire. The target gains a +30 bonus to this test on any round during which he performs an action with the Movement subtype.
