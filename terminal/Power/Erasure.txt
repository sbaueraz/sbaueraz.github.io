ERASURE:

With a surgeon’s skill, the psyker opens up his target’s mind and slices away a memory, removing it forever. This power is of immense utility to an Inquisitor’s work, particularly one who wishes to operate discreetly, without the usual mess of an execution.

Effect: The psyker chooses a single foe in range and line of sight who opposes this power with a Willpower test. If he fails, the psyker removes a memory of a recent event from the target’s mind. The psyker can only remove an amount of time from the target’s memory up to 10 x PR minutes, and the event removed cannot have occurred more than PR hours prior to the use of this power. The enemy is left with a gap in his memory, with no recollection of what occurred during that time.
