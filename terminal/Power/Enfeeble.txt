Effect: The psyker nominates a single target in range and line of sight who opposes this power with a Toughness test. If the target fails to resist the power, it is Stunned for one round. In addition, as long as this power remains in effect, if the target rolls doubles on any test it makes, it suffers a number of levels of Fatigue equal to half the psykerâ€™s psy rating (rounded down). A single target can only be affected by one instance of the Enfeeble power at a time, with other usages on the same target having no further effect.
