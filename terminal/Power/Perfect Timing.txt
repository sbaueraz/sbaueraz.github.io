PERFECT TIMING:

So accurate are the diviner’s premonitions, that he can predict the exact moment his foe will expose himself as a target. Further, the psyker can forge a link with his allies, momentarily intertwining their fortunes, so that they might fire in perfect unison, already squeezing their weapons’ triggers before the foe is aware.
