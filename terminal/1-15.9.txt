Log#005:

After the riot I was feeling sure that something good would come our way and now months later it has come! The God Emperor rewards his faithful with food. I finally have the energy to record on this log again. We lost a lot of good people, but the Lord Miltant has assured us that those who stay faithful will never want for anything more. 

Now that the hunger is finally under control I don't feel so stupid for going to the medicae to get looked at for my headache. Hurts so bad that it's painful to think. I think a few other people feel the same, lingering effects from starvation is what my friends tell me the medicae told them. Makes sense I guess.
