	How long we've searched, years of hiding, driven away from our families, our dreams. Our child condemned to a life of hardship and loss. Never to know the love of our God Emperor, or of their Imperium that we her parents gave so much to secure for them. 
	I used to think on cold nights under tatered rags, while looking up at the lights of those living their lives serving He Who Sits On Terra, what will life be like for our child once we're gone? I used to never have an answer. But now? After meeting people like the Panaards, and Miss Vynes, I can start to see a future appearing. Their promises aren't empty, what they showed us spoke to me, Lethe too; spoke of a brighter tomorrow within the Imperium, one where even we can bask in the warm light of the ecclesiarchy's love. 
	Even after all this hardship, I would still do anything for the Golden Throne, and what more, for our child. I can't wait to see them again.
