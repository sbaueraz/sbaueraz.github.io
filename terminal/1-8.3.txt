Log-015:

The sound has grown louder, more clear. It is as though a siren calls out to me. Nani hears its call as well. It chosen us. We must be secretive, I have not seen the source but whatever it is must be important as the cargo hold is guarded more heavily than I have ever seen. 
They are not part of the Merciful, corporate guns if I had to wager. Our duties on board seem distant in comparison to the droning call from the hold. I have spoken with others among my caste, they do not hear it as we do. The Gilded, our Echlesiarchal caste of priests have often preached that to hear the voice of He Who Sits on Terra is to know thine true purpose. Well there is no doubt now that this is the word of our God. 
According to the ships manifest the box containing what the God Emperor wants me to have is being unloaded to a heretic on the hive world of Scintilla. Within the hive I will be able to escape with it and vanish into the city. It will be our own, our precious. Then when we have it in our possession we will finally hear clearly what the Divine Throne wishes of me, my wife, and our new child.
