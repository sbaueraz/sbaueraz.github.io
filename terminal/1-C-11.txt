So I know we lace Cherry 40k with addictive chemicals to drive increased usage. But the question lingers, how do we get them hooked in the first place? The answer is in Vid Recording Advertisement! Picture this if you will:


*You are walking down the street, a vid feed appears on the nearest holo signage or cogitator screen.*

*A shaggy haired man walks up from the mist* "Greetings hive citizen, are you ready to accept your quest from the Hegemony?" 

*A hive citizen walks up to join him* "Of course, but first!" 

*the citizen cracks open a bottle of Cherry 40k, Glug glug glug glug glug* "Ahhhh, refreshing!"

*The shaggy haired man remarks* "What was that citizen?"

*The citizen remarks excitedly* "Why it's Cherry 40k of course!"

"Ah Cherry 40k" the hairy man says longingly looking directly into the vid, "Sparkling, tasty, and refreshing, a great companion for any servant of the Skaelen-Har!"

End scene.

I was thinking of having the skit potentially go on longer where we use an alegory about falling into a giants cup and needing to drink the entire thing of Cherry 40k to avoid drowning in it. We would say something about how what a glorious way to die it would be drinking Cherry 40k. We'll workshop it a bit. 

What do you think?!
