	Quinto and Lethe Al-Farez *insisted* on performing these tests on our captured subject... it seems prolonged exposure may have... a form of effect upon an individual who is not faithful. I tried to tell them that this is not indicitive of what would happen to the faithful... the idol it... has intelligence. 
 
 The Emperor of Mankind speaks through the idol, and to one who lacks the faith, the vision, to do what is needed, will naturally be forced to show their true form. That of an abomination like what we now have imprissoned here. The creature is all fang and claw. Nothing left of the trickster agent who stumbled upon our hideout here.

 We will keep this woman here who apparently is... was... named Lois Monet. At least if anyone stumbles across her they won't recognize her. Now to get the others back under control. And begin the next stage of the process... the idol's requires spies.
