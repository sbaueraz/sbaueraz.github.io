Assigned Retinue: Scintilla Squadron E-2

Designated Insertion Point: Slagerfeld Spire Skt. Agnus

Departure Location: TBD

Objectives: SSE-2, you're being assigned to a longterm mission within the Slagerfeld. Informants within the Upper Spire of the Skaelen-Har have tipped us off to a powerful xenos relic being moved into the sector and into the hands of an unknown noble house. Ground sources indicate turmoil within that plan regarding delivery going rogue and the relic going into hiding. 

Relic is to be handled with care and is classified as an Alpha Tier threat level should it fall into the wrong hands. Adeptus Administratum research has shown possible sightings in other sectorums in centuries past where a relic meeting this ones description was found preceding complete annihilation from xenos of classification Tyranid Hive Fleet Behemoth. 

Mission is to locate and contain this relic, sources conclude that relic has a powerful psionic presence and is to not be interacted with under any circumstances. Long term exposure leads to psionic contamination of the spirit and possible physical infection via Genestealer Strain. Exterminate any who have had prolonged contact. 

Secondary objective is to determine who transported the object and for what purpose and eliminate the heretic. However primary objective remains containment of the relic. Resources have been arranged upon your arrival however future reinforcement will not be available as all other assets are tied up with major issues occuring on Dusk and Coscarla. I will only be reachable by astropathic transmission. The nearest choir will be at the Bastion Porphyr in Sibellus, not an easy journey so extraction will need to be organized by yourselves at the time of mission success. I will meet with you personally in orbit above Scintilla once I have receieved word and we can deal with the relic at such a time.
