I have arrived at Hab-001313 and was met by my good friend Carmen. I was suspicious at first that this was just some dead end report that was going to end up with the culprit being old pipes and faulty machine spirits but seeing the look of terror on Carmens face tells me that this must be something serious.

Upon arriving I met the sweetest little girl. She said her name was Synthia. She seemed so nice but Carmen refused to look or interact with her. Is she so on edge by whatever is happening here that she can't entertain an innocent small child? Carmen said I can stay next door to her in room 405. It seems nice enough. In the morning I'll start my interviews and see if there might actually be a story here.
