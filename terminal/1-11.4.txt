Willheim Barnaby:

Cogitator still works? Seems so, leaving this here just incase another scavenger finds this. Reached out to the Lord Militants vox signal and it still works! Partner is talking with one of their officers right now. The legend is true! The bastards survived in there! We are heading there now, can't wait to bring back this news to the our contacts up above they're going to freak out. Let this be part of the proof that the legendary explorer Willheim Barnaby discovered what none thought existed, the Manor of the Lord Militant himself!

Edit: Seems the vox signal is being listened to by more than just the Lord Militant, as soon as we contacted them we were ambushed by mutants. Caution advised.
