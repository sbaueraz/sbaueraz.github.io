Log Entry: Magos Glitchius Scrub

Day 1: Brilliant Idea

During a routine inspection, I tripped over a discarded cog and fell into a vat of cleaning solvent. Inspiration struck! The Omnissiah demands cleanliness. Thus, "Operation Cog-Clean" was born. Praise the Machine God—and the janitor servitors.

Day 2: Scavenging for Parts

Collected spare parts: servo-mops, scrubber drones, and an overclocked suction unit. Tech-Acolyte Duster suggested adding scented oils for "a pleasant working environment." Duster is now polishing plasma coils as punishment for frivolity. This is a forge, not a spa!

Day 4: Assembly Begins

Built the first prototype: the Scrub-A-Tron 9000. Accidentally programmed it to clean everything. Including me. Spent the next hour avoiding a very persistent brush. Adjustments needed.

Day 6: Initial Testing

Released Scrub-A-Tron 9000 into the main forge. It cleaned with zeal—too much zeal. Scrubbed the paint off half the machines and attempted to buff the servo-skulls. Skulls are now unnervingly shiny. Note: dial back the enthusiasm.

Day 8: Field Deployment

Deployed revised Scrub-A-Tron 9000 units across the forge. They now clean floors, walls, and machinery efficiently. One unit malfunctioned and tried to clean Tech-Priest Scourius’s robes mid-sermon. Scourius was not amused, but the robes have never looked better.

Day 10: Project Success

Operation Cog-Clean is a sparkling success! The forge is spotless, morale is up, and my fall into the solvent is now referred to as "The Blessed Tumble." Scrub-A-Tron 9000 units are affectionately called "The Holy Scrubbers."
