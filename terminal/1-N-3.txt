	The icon has great powers, it can warp flesh into the emperors glory. The nobility would see this kept out of the peoples hands but I would see it gifted to all of mankinds servants. 
	We have used the Idol full power only once, I listened to its voice and through it the emperor told me what to do. The process was slow however, years in the making of one in the emperors true form. 
	Nani whispers to me that there exists a place where we can use the icon to its fullest and bring about a new golden era for mankind. I try to listen closer for these secrets myself but it is hard to make out. The Panaards are closer to it than any of us, I will trust in their wisdom, in the emperors wisdom. The transformation was too much for the heretic to bear and so their mind crumbled into that of a beast, but those who are true to the God Emperor will transcend, and those who are false will peel away and their true ugliness revealed to all. 
	So is the word of He Who Sits on Terra.
