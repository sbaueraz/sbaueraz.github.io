Narrowly avoided capture by the Magistratum once again. We need to be more careful. They are always looking for heretics in their midst. The Changer of Ways would not accept a diversion to his great plan.
 
Let me know when you get a shipment of the contaminated Obscura in off the Misericorde and I will run it down to the Dream Lounge. 
 
Until then we should cease communications until heat dies down on my end. Thankfully you have avoided suspicion from the authorities, keep it that way until the next shipment and our plan will continue. Make damn sure you delete this message once you read it.
