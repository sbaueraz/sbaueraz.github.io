Log#001:

Here lies the data log of Captain Titus of the Scintilla Planetary Defense Forces assigned to Lord Militant Marbicus Cassman at his private manor in the Leiberman-Iacos District of the Slagerfeld Spire. 

We have taken stock of supplies, we have enough for twice the number of men that are here to survive for at least a few years so I've been told. The Lord Militant himself is badly injured and in a coma. That places me in command of this facility.

I have chosen not to inform the public about the Lord Militants status. I feel it will strengthen my command if I have the ability to fall back on the Lord Militant backing my decisions. In the meantime I have set up a system of rations that will keep the men fed well enough while I decide how we will proceed from here. Power is back up finally and our tech savants have assured me the generators are self sustaining now. 

They told me that they are working on fixing the Vox Transmitters now so that help can be contacted. The audacity, I am the one in charge, not them. They will work on what I tell them to work on. I made it clear that making unprompted decisions in the future will result in harsh punishment.
