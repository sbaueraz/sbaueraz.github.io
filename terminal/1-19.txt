Due to your injuries on the fields of battle in service to the Golden Throne during the battle of the (Spineward Front) you are hereby relieved of duty. 

Your injuries include intense warp trauma at the hands of the (Greenskin) enemy in a way that cannot be repaired. Instead you are being deported back to the (Calixis Sector Capital) where the Adeptus Terra shall process an associated stipend for you to live off of. 

Please plan for (65,326,953) years for processing.

Thank you for your service Guardsman.
