Patient File: Lorna Skar

Appointment 1: Age 29, Weight 132, Single, No Child

Reason for Visitation: MUTATION

Log 1: Lorna is no ordinary hab skum looking for reprieve from some contrived pain, or minor life threatening illness. She has a gift... Something spectacular. Something that I must learn more about. 

Log 2: Her mutation is fascinating... she has some physical mutations, mainly her palms which have developed extra ocular organs, however her main gift appears to be in her mind. She is capable of projecting her thoughts through the void and into others heads. I have bore witness to this event myself and it is quite mystical. Who knows what she could be capable of with proper training?
