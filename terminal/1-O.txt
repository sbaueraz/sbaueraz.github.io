Rawna,
 
We have just received word from port authorities at Skt Agnus that our shipment of 7,000,000 tons of plasteel has arrived... Do you see any issue with that? Because I do! You missed not one, not two, but THREE ZEROES on that order Rawna!
 
Do you know how long it takes for these shipments to come in? We're going to have to pay premium prices now from the Misericorde once it docks in order to stay operational thorugh the quarter!
 
Not everything is lost however... you owe us big time now. Time to pay up and I know just the way... Hope you know some mercenaries.
 
Come see me at my office, if you don't show, consider yourself fired. Or worse.
