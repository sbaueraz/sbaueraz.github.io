Data Log#003:


It has almost been half a terran year. We had our fist riot. After the collapse I was hoping I wouldn't have to patch up combat wounds for a while. Seems I was wrong. I count almost two dozen dead. Twice that number injured. Would have been worse if so many of us weren't starving. Captain Titus said that help is still coming, that we need to keep faith. At this point though I'm just doing my job. If the Lord Militant knew I had lost faith he might have me executed like the others. But I'm no dummy, if we don't find a solution soon there won't be anyone left for the God Emperor to save.
