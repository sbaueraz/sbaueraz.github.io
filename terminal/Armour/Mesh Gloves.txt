Mesh Gloves:

Although usually looking no different than common fabric gloves worn for fashion or protection from cool weather, the mesh construction can allow the wearer to literally grab an attacker’s knife by the blade and yank it out of his hand. Powdered steel is sometimes sewn into the knuckles and backs of the palm to create a more painful punch, which can be useful in situations where the wearer can’t use a more effective weapon.
