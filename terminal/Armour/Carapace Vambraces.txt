Carapace Vambraces:

These vambraces totally protect the wearer’s arms, with tubular armaplas or ceramite sections for the forearm and upper arms and fully articulated sections for the elbow and hand. Some versions totally protect the back of the wearer’s hands and may have segmented sections for the digits as well, often bonded to a mesh or flakweave glove to maintain flexibility. Because of their sturdy construction, a punch from a carapace-armoured fist is often just as deadly, if not more so, than a knuckle duster.
