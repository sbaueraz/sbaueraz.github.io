Arbitrator Combat Carapace:

Worn by even novice troopers in the field all the way up to the stern judges and marshals, the Adeptus Arbites are probably best known by their fierce-looking carapace suits. body Arbitrator carapace is a full suit of articulated ceramite reinforced plates, with broad shoulders and boots and gauntlets meant for “hands-on” work. A visored helmet covers the head and most of the face, and can be fitted with a rebreather for use during gas attacks or patrols in underhive sumps. While the armour itself is more or less standardized, Arbites agents often customize it based on their rank and roles. Troopers controlling cyber-mastiffs usually don a storm coat over their armour to hearken back to the protective coats worn by dog handlers in prehistory, while judges and marshals often affix a golden eagle insignia or ornament to their helmets, literally bringing the symbol of the Emperor’s Justice to recidivists and scummers while keeping their hands free to use weapons and other combat gear. Arbitrator combat armour includes an integral micro-bead and Good craftsmanship photovisor in the helmet. The micro-bead can power an attached vox-amplifier, which can turn the wearer’s shouts into deafening roars, and small stab-lights can be attached to the armour’s shoulders. These systems can be powered by a small battery unit or a lasgun charge pack, which has enough energy for up to a week’s worth of continuous use (about 170 hours).
