Flakweave Cloak:

This heavy cloak includes a separate hood and cape that is fastened around the shoulders, and vaguely resembles an Ecclesiarchial mantellum. It is made from many thin flakweave layers that move smoothly over top one another as the wearer’s body is in motion, which permits ease of movement in spite of the cloak’s weight. It offers a reasonable degree of protection while not appearing unlike normal if heavy clothing, and the expansive folds of the cloak can also allow the wearer to stow a lot of hardware against their body without being too visually conspicuous to outside observation.
