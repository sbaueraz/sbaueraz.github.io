Magistratum Combat Carapace:

This articulated carapace suit is produced by the forge of Hax-Orthlack for the Lord Sector’s Magistratum enforcers on Scintilla, but is also sold to similar organizations on other hive worlds throughout the Calixis Sector. Though its armour protection is modest, designed to turn away knives and low-calibre guns typically used by ganger scum, the Magistratum armour is very well designed and almost completely encloses the wearer’s body. The helmet is deliberately designed to resemble a skull, with a vent-like respirator and individual flash-reactive eyepieces, while rugged but elegant styling make the wearer vaguely resemble a Terran cohort of the Adeptus Custodes, right down to the leather balteum worn at the waist. The skeletal visages of carapace-armoured Magistratum enforcers are often the last things seen by a recidivist in Hive Sibellus, assuming the Arbitrators don’t get to him first. The suit of armour includes a respirator, micro-bead, and photo-visor in its helmet. The respirator normally functions as a gas mask, but can also be used as a closed-cycle rebreather, and with all parts of the Magistratum carapace worn, the wearer is concealed to be in sealed armour as long as the rebreather is active. Additionally, the fierce visage of the helmet itself grants the wearer a +10 bonus on Intimidate Tests.
