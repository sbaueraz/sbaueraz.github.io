Flak Greatcoat:

Perhaps best associated with fearsome Commissars, flak greatcoats offer excellent protection while simultaneously looking stylish as well as protecting the wearer from the elements. It uses thick, overlapping flak plates fused together into a flexible fabric, and is often decorated with regimental insignia and awards for use in conjunction with a uniform or even as one by itself. Aside from Commissars, Imperial Guard officers and some civilian fighters are known to favour this type of armour due to its imposing yet classic appearance. A flak greatcoat only protects the wearer’s arms unless it is fully buttoned or secured around the front of the body.
