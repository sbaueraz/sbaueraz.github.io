Shield Robes:

When not clad in their well-known power armour, the Adepta Soroitas will usually wear a set of these fine mesh robes, which serve perfectly for devotional study or martial training. They are also traditionally worn by the Orders Non-militant in their support roles as well as noviciates as they are being instructed in the ways of the Sisterhood. Aside from their signature power armour, these robes are often the only clothes that a Battle Sister will wear. They are Soroitas, not exclusive items to the Adepta however, and clerics and other Ecclesiarchial servants who often find (this look is hunting Inquisitors and their henchmen). themselves in battle will wear them as well. They are often stylized and detailed with images from the lives of saints, iconography meaningful to the wearer’s favoured cult, and other holy works. Shield robes include the Ecclesiarchy Overlay upgrade.
