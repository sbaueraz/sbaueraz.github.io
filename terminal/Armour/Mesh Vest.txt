Mesh Vest:

This plain but no less effective vest can be easily worn under almost any kind of clothing, protecting the wearer’s vitals while allowing him to operate undercover with almost no difficulty in concealing his armour. Most are simply pulled over the head, the wondrous construction stretching effortlessly when being put on but becoming a sturdy shield against blades and bullets immediately thereafter.
