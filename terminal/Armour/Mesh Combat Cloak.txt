Mesh Combat Cloak:

This armour offers a superb combination of protection and easy wearing characteristics, making it a favourite of just about any fighter who can afford its expense. Depending on style, a mesh combat cloak could easily pass for a long raincoat, outerwear for a chilly day, or if suitably decorated, a cape or robe fit for a noble’s masquerade ball. The folds of a combat cloak are long and loose enough to cover the wearer’s arms and legs, while a removable hood offers protection for the head as well. A mesh combat cloak is worn similar to the much more common (and less expensive) flakweave cloak, and possession of one is a sure example of a fighter’s financial standings (or that of his employers).
