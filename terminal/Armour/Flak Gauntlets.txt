Flak Gauntlets:

Flak gauntlets are formed in the main by sturdy plates worn around the arms over a reinforced fabric glove that reaches up to the elbow. There’s usually an additional plate to protect the back of the hand as well, and more advanced models might even include reinforcement on the tops of the fingers too.
