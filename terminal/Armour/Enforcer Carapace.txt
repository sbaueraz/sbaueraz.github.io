Enforcer Light Carapace:

So named because it is a frequent choice for PDF heavies and the private troops of noble houses and planetary leaders, enforcer light carapace is a lightweight suit of armour that is fairly easy to wear and maintain. It is more costly than lesser armours, but is still modestly priced for how much protection it offers. Enforcer carapace’s individual plates are designed to be easily replaced if they become damaged, which helps keep operating expenses reasonable. Of course, it can also be considered something of a bad omen to receive a suit of armour with a single obviously new plate.
